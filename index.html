    <h1>Interview transcripts</h1>
    <p>
        Taynia interview:
Maintenance request upload that on. Through App folio, and then. Any request for showing 
for tours. Or so we do that. And then we go into the Michael things that we actually. Go in 
to see if there's any complaints or anything that needs to be done, if we have move out or 
move in inspections or so forth. So that's what our typical week would look like. And we do 
do reports. We have monthly. Weekly and quarterly reports that we have to complete. And 
what when you talk about those kind of like. Routine reports. I'm curious. Like, who are 
those reports for? And what do you have to kind of include and track in them. 


So those reports are for the Duraam, for the director and for the property itself. So if 
it's delinquent reports, those have to go with a tenant it needs, you know, for rental. If 
it is reports that you know, maintenance. Anything like that. And it goes. In and it goes 
to the director for review. 


Gotcha. And I know you said there's kind of a couple properties that you kind of work with. 
Is all of that kind of work and reporting and looking up information about maintenance 
requests. Does that all happen, like on site? Are you able to kind of gather that 
information remotely or, you know, talk to me about kind of showing. How the process goes 
that 


everyone has a portal. So if you do have a maintenance request, you have to submit it to 
your portal, even if it is after hours. We do have an emergency number. And that goes 
through our portal in the morning. What I would do is I would make sure. So I assign it to 
our maintenance Department. It is and what they'll do, they schedule it. And then if it 
needs to be done outside, if there's an outside vendor or maintenance Department will do 
we'll get in touch with the outside vendor or he let me know, and then I assign it and send 
it through. So there are many components. Or maintenance apparently important to our. 
Functional Daily functions. 


Can I understandably? I'm curious. Kind of what you find the most rewarding about the work 
that you do. 


Well. It's the people, you know, the attendance that we meet. Showing. A tour getting. You 
know, getting up in the morning and making sure that every unit is okay. There is a 
maintenance request. I mean, I make sure that it's. Scheduled. It's a sign schedule. 
Everything goes through. And that's what I love about this job. It's getting to getting the 
job done and also meeting, you know, the residents or the new or a prospective resident 
that comes in for a tour. 


Gotcha I'm curious, then what kind of the most challenging part of the job is for you. 


So the most housing part of the job is. You. Once you get. Someone gets and they're like, 
yes, I want this place. And then. You send them out. A reminder or you send them out. You 
know. An app or you send them out toward the they don't, you know, they not able to make 
it, you know, and they don't say, Well, I'm not, you know, they don't respond. We are thing 
by saying. And you're sitting down waiting for someone. And you know, it's time. My thing 
is time. If you're not able to make an appointment, just let us know if you want to be 
late. Just let us know. Like this morning. I'm so we're sorry. Time gotta meet? Because 
we're waiting for a technician to come? But, oh, understandable. But so that's. The 
challenging part of the job for me. 


Yeah, well, and I know you kind of talked about like you have this portal that you use to 
kind of check, you know, requests. You mentioned kind of putting these reports together. 
I'm curious. Kind of. What tools do you use at work to help you do your job? And like I'd 
love to know specific names, you know of what portal you use, or if there's a program you 
use for the reports or anything. 


It is app Folio everything we do is in outfolio all our tools. Are in our Folio so Apple so 
we do have task at the each day. It will assign you task and then that will help the 
workflow of your day. So everything is done on that. Program. 


Gotcha okay. On a scale of one to five. Where one is much worse. And five is much improved. 
How improved is your daytoday work life based on the technology you have supporting you. 


I would say five, because. It is it's really an easy. The upfolio is really friendly so if 
you don't understand something. They always have support. To get to you. You can always 
reach out to someone and they will actually walk you through. If you have a problem, they 
can walk you through it. So that's one of the best things with that. Application 


gotcha and is that talk to me about like what that support might look like. If you're you 
know, trying to do something and you can't remember how it does. How do you access that 
support. 


So. Whatever page that you're on there is. Get help and then you can actually email or you 
can click on that get help because you're actually in that particular. Page and then you'll 
have support that will actually send you back an email. Or whatever it is. But they always 
walk you through the steps. And also there's always online training because each area has 
its online so you don't remember how to particularly do something. You can always go back 
to the online training and it will walk you through the steps or. You do have access. To 
support that they are there. And one thing can tell you that they always if you need help. 
It save right now there's always someone there to help you to guide you along the way. 


Gotcha I can see why that's helpful. I'm curious. You know how does technology. I heard you 
kind of talk about how it makes your job easier. For sure. I'm curious how it makes your 
job harder, if at all. 


Well. To be honest if we didn't have this, if we didn't have a folio. I'm not sure how you 
know it will be fun with function because it has been. A tool that has. Every. Property 
management company does have. A folder. It is where. You're it's as they say, it's one of 
those things that you cannot do without every program. Leases everything is based on that 
one program. It would be. Very challenging for me. If. That program went, if we're not able 
to access that program. So if everything the portal you know, you have to sign up as you 
become attendant or a resident, you have to sign up for that portal and meet them goes 
through there. Your nieces go through there. You upload your information. You applied on 
that. On that portal. So it is it would be very you know, it would be really stressful if 
you lost it for a day because everything is functions through there. 


Yeah for sure. Well, thank you for kind of, you know, talking me through kind of what all 
the things that you're juggling and what's helpful in that. I kind of want to shift gears a 
little bit and talk about iotas and adt. And before we kind of jump into details, I just 
kind of first want to have a better understanding of. Kind of how you think about iotas 
adt. So in your own words, could you kind of talk to me about the products the iotas adt 
products that you're building uses. 


Okay. So. We used. We used it at more of our properties. Unfortunately, we're not managing 
that property anymore. But it. Was. From the time that we had installed and gotten it was 
actually Very, very. I would say easy to use, but it was very user friendly. So it was. For 
when the resident. Got in. It was easy to change numbers. They would send them an email. 
They would have the code. It would be. And I thought that and even the alerts came in very 
quickly. If there was an issue. It would even if when the batteries had gone, you know the 
batteries are low. You would get that alert that the batches are low. You need to do this. 
You need. So I thought that it was a very, very friendly program. Very easy. One of the 
best I would see programs that I have seen. And used for the time that we were using it. 
And I would actually recommend it to anybody because I thought it was really, really great. 


Yeah. And so I know you said you're no longer. Managing that property. Do you remember the 
name of the property? That. 


's what was it? Valley. 


Gotcha. And then how recently was that kind of transition? Was it a transition of 
ownership, or was it a job change? 


No, it was transitional. I would say property management. So they became. It was the 1 
March. Okay. New property management company to go over 


gotcha. Okay. So very recently, 


yes. 


And so it sounds like, you know, it sounds like you guys had, like, the door, you know, 
codes for the doors. Do you know what if they had any other sort of products there, whether 
that was the only product that we had there. Okay. So just the doors. Gotcha. And so I'm 
curious. 

What if anything, how did it help your residents, in particular. 


Well, it was. For them. They it was easy for them to get in and get out. You put in your 
door, quote, and you're in, you can lock the door. I mean, we had a model unit there. So we 
were using the door, and I found it quite easy. All I need to do was put it in lock and. Go 
and then you know when I'm going, but I'm going back in open and go. So it was more it was 
a very user friendly for me. For the residents 


gotcha. What do you wish was different about iot's adt? If anything, 


I don't think there are anything. They don't need to make any changes at all. As I said it 
was if the dashboard, I mean wants anything was wrong. They would alert and which was quick 
response, real time, which was really good. There's some that do not do that. But this one 
did. And I thought it was a fantastic. You know. Thing to do to the property. You 


know. Yeah. And with those alerts. Is that something. Did you kind of check the property 
dashboard, like at a regular cadence? Was it something where you kind of waited for an 
alert in your email and then went to the. Sometimes that I would sometimes I would check on 
a I would check it. But then there are sometimes you're kind of busy. But when the lords 
come in, 


I would make sure. Put a note you know I would set up maintenance. This door need you know, 
please change the battery at the store and so forth and it would be done immediately. As I 
said, it's real time. 


Awesome. Thank you. And I know I don't remember. I don't know how long ago, you know, that 
property started iotus. Was it, you know, fairly recently. 


From January. 


Okay. Talk to me a little bit about how you learned how to use those products. 

We got set up. And we had a trading program. And it was it you know, which at the time. I 
was sent the information. I signed up. Went in. And that was it. It really was as I said, 
user friendly. I didn't have to do much training. I decided to make sure that I whenever 
there's an alert, you just have to make sure that you get because you have residents in so 
you want to make sure that everything is done quickly. Because you don't want anything. 
That's how they get in to their home. So, you know. Yeah. And I know you've mentioned a 
couple of times, you know, you really liked it because it was really easy to use talk to me 
about kind of what in that experience. Made it so easy, so intuitive to use. Well, I am 
used to a lot of door clothes itself, but I thought that this one was. 


Really. It. I wouldn't say it's that simple, but. It was easy for the rest. It was easy to 
explain. We had a cheat sheet. We gave to the resident. They sent them an email to set up 
their door code, because usually. Other places that I've been, I have to give them my door 
code. So and then they set it up for this one that didn't happen. So it was more of the 
custom arm. The resident is basically Privacy. So they would know their own. We couldn't 
get in usually maintenance, you know, we would have access, but this one was really. Raised 
security because I couldn't use micro to get into anywhere, you know. So as I said, 
everything was. Pat down, everything had its own. Thing. Each resident was extremely happy. 
For what they you know how the system was. 


Gotcha. Do you have a sense of how often your residents were using, you know, their iotas 
products today. 


As of today. No. But as of when you were there. They were I would say they were using this 
a lot because they were in and out in and out. So anything about it. We knew when. The you 
know, it was when the AC needed to be adjusted. And so for, you know, when it dropped. And 
so it was a lot of, you know, a lot of good things that were actually. So I could say that. 
They were using it a lot, especially with the weather that we have had here. So I think 
that yeah, I think they were using a lot. 


Gotcha. And I can't remember where you are talking about kind of what impact the weather 
has on the 


use. So the weather. So. I'm in Arkansas. So we've had some very. You know, very cold. And 
we've had storms rolling and so forth. But if they did held up because I know that when we 
had a that storm with a lot of ice and rain. And so I was able I mean, I used to buy I was 
able to get in. Very quickly, you know, was freezing outside. And I was, you know, put in 
my code, and I was able to just go in. I was able to adjust the. Ac to heat. And we are 
also so the empty units that we the units that were not occupied. We were able to adjust. 
Them remotely. We were able. We got a code that we could go in and so forth. So it was 
easy. As I said, it was much better because I could we could not go out for a few days. So 
whatever we were able to check to see what was going on. At the ones that were vacant. 


Just by using your 


you know, your system. 


Okay, so with those, like, unoccupied units, is that something where you're able to do all 
of those adjustments from the Property dashboard? You don't have to be. Not have to be 
there. 

Awesome. Well, in terms of kind of you definitely kind of have a shared benefits that 
you're seeing iotas ADT bring to residents today. I'm curious that there are any kind of 
additional benefits that you kind of wish that in the future. Iota cdt would be able to 
offer to residents. 


I don't see anything right now. Because I was the only property that we had that actually 
used it. So I and it was new to me, so I cannot I'm not I think that it was fantastic. It 
did everything it was supposed to do as it advertised. So I don't see anything else that it 
would. You know, I'm sure there's a lot of benefits after they go back, but for me 
personally, for the few months that we had it, I can't see anything else. 


Yeah for sure. And do any of the other properties that you use kind of have, are they 
incorporating. Smart technology at all? Or is that kind of the only property that you know 
we have. We do have 


another property, but it's not with Ad. It's not with it's not there. They're using a 
different company. So this one. Value looks is the only one that we are using. 


With our chat. And are they kind of comparable in terms of what they offer to your 
residents or in terms of. Experience. You know, I'm curious. Kind of how the two compare 
for you. 


Well for me. They're both. Very, very good. One. Is at a home. It's singlefamily. And the 
other one is apartments. So they're just so totally different. I don't think that I would. 
With the apartments that we have, they chose a different model. That well, they use and I 
think that the one that they have at the home. It would be as much. It's really for the 
home. The one for the apartments. It's for the apartment. So that's the only thing 


gotcha. And I and the ADT was that for the apartments or for the homes. 


No. For the homes. 


Okay. For the homes. Okay. Thank you. I'm curious. You know, when we're thinking about 
running reports and all the things that you're trying to gather. Is there information that. 
You're gaining about your residents or their buildings that you find valuable that you're 
receiving from iotas adt today. 


Well. For well. For. The system. Yes. When we had the property. Because. It will tell us 
what was going on with the proxy. Now I we don't have access to it anymore, so I can't tell 
you how it's performing. But once it was, we were able to run report. We were able to check 
to see what was going on. The alerts dashboard and all of that. 


Gotcha so I know you kind of talked about like you get alerts about low battery. What other 
kind of information. Specific information. Could you get that you found valuable from you 
know. 


If the AC. Is. Low. Sorry if the AC units you know what the temperature is in. Rule. Almond 
rule. You know, in the house. Or I should say. Also we've had. Where. A resident could not 
get in. So which was you know. They were able to make sure that she was able to because she 
didn't get that email. So she was able to do her thing, but everyone else have had it was 
really great. She was the only one I believe that had a little issue when she moved in, but 
that has been fixed now. 


Gotcha. And was that something that you were alerted about, or did she kind of have to 
reach out to say, like, Hey. I was there with her. Yes, I was there with her. And she had 
mentioned that she had not gotten that email because 


everyone else had gotten an email. To choose your code. Usually so with the other one, the 
other. Smart log that we have. We would set the code for them, and we give them a key fob 
and all of that which. For this property. They would actually. An email will be sent on the 
time of move in and then they choose their own code so we do not have access to their code 
at all. So she had said she had not gotten that email, so we made sure we reached out. And 
she got and she was able to set her. Code and all of that. And she was able to get in and 
out and use her code and do her. 


And in terms of kind of getting all of that organized talk to me about, you know, like how. 
Are those emails getting sent out? How is that? You know, how is the information known who 
is moving in? Is that you know information you need to enter? Is that information. 


That we need to enter. They would know so. About time of moving. We do do a welcome letter. 
We set up we do set up everything for them. But in this case we do notify that someone is 
going to be moving in so about a day or so before. They would get their information about 
their. Code 


gotcha. And talk to me about that process of, you know, on top of all the other stuff that 
you do. Kind of the process of preparing for a new resident, including. Entering that stuff 
into the I'm assuming into the dashboard is that where you 


would 


generate. 


So what happens is after the resident signs of these. Resident comes in Tours. Yes, I do 
want that they submit to an application. They do a screening once they're been approved, at 
least is sent out. And then we do send them out to welcome letter a few days before they 
actually when we do send a letter out where they have to put everything in there, you know, 
the water. Lights, all the utilities. There is a fee that we will on that property as a 
feed that we charge for. This Smart bundle. And. Then after that. They will actually, we 
notify the company that this person is going to be moving in on this date. And a day before 
they would actually. Send them an email. Request and then they will in that email. Will 
say, Well, can you choose your code? And it would be whatever code they choose, which is 
only privy to there. So we don't know what their code is. And there's it. 


Yeah. Thank you. That makes a lot of sense. I want to shift gears. A little bit. And talk 
about you know, as we think about. Their smart technology. You're seeing that with you 
know. The alerts about the door batteries to let you know access to door codes. Where 
there's you know more Privacy for residents. Alerts about temperature. That type of thing. 
I'm curious. Kind of. What your thoughts about. What roles Security plays with Smart 
technology, if any. 


Well. In that case mean no one else knows your code. So. You can put in your code without 
and then getting to your that you don't get in. But the only thing that well for me 
personally, it's just that if someone you know if anything happens and you're trying and 
the battery is low. And we don't get that alert and you're trying to get in. I always get 
the customer a key anyhow so they should have their key on them. So that's my only concept, 
because if you're in a if you know there's something going on, you're trying to get in and 
you're not able to get it. To your apartment, to your home. Using. Because technology, as 
you know. It does go sometimes and you it may have a fluke and you're trying to get in and 
you cannot. You know, so that's the only thing that I have I always give a key. To. With 
this property. I did give them a key. Just, you know, just in case something happens and 
you can't use your you can't get in. You know. They're able to use their key so that's all 
that's a good thing about. Value. 


Having that kind of backup. 


Yes. 


Are there, like additional security features that you can think of that would be beneficial 
to you and your property or your residents. 


Well. For me. Don't know the app. So if. You're trying to get in, get in because it's not. 
I mean, it's touch. It's a touchdown. Touchscreen. So you know, download, you know, there's 
an app which I don't know if there's an app because I did everything has an app now, but if 
you have an app, you're supposed to be able. To be able to. Put in your code and open your 
door. From that app. You should be able to do anything from the app. And I'm not saying 
there is not an app. It's just that I didn't know because I don't have I've always just 
punched in the thing. So if there is an app yay, there's nothing app. I think we should 
have an app. Safe. If I'm like two minutes away or if I reach my house. I'm on a driveway. 
I should be able to use the app to open my to open the door. 


Gotcha 


have access to the device. 


Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you. Well, I appreciate you sharing a little bit more about 
the experience that your property has had. We're gonna shift gears for a little bit, and 
I'm going to share my screen. We'll complete an activity together, and the goal of it is to 
kind of get a better understanding of what is most important to you. And so I'm going to 
share a list of needs that you might have in your job. And then I'm going to ask you to 
kind of sort them and plot them on. This. Pyramid, which I'll show you. So we have at the 
very top of the pyramid. You'll see, there's one a place for one sticky. And that's what 
you need the most out of all of these needs. And then it'll go from kind of most important, 
all the way to the bottom, where this is what I could live without. And so what I'll do is 
we'll read through what these needs are. And I want you to think about what your most 
important need is. And then we'll start plotting all the other ones as well. We also have a 
space so that after we go through these needs, if there's something that you think of 
that's missing from the list, let me know and we'll add it there. So we have make the tasks 
I complete on a daily basis, easier to do helpless, identify optimizations to save money 
and. Increase efficiency. Ensure residents feel safe and protected. Ensure myself and other 
property staff feels safe and protected. Help us make our buildings feel like a community. 
Make communicating with my team and with residents easier. Help us attract new residents 
and help us retain existing residents. Are there any other needs that you can think of that 
you would like to add. 


Maybe if we continue going on, maybe something will come to you, but basically everything 
is quite sad. 


Okay. Perfect. Well, from there, I'm curious if any kind of anything jumps out to you as 
the most important or talk me through your thought process. If you're figuring out 


sure, the first thing ensured that the residents feel safe and protected. That would be the 
first one for me, right? Talk to me about why that is. Because. You are. You have come into 
a new place. And you would want to make sure that we are that you are safe and you are 
protected. You. This is your new home. Away from home. And you want to make sure that 
nothing happens. I would. Sure nothing happens to you. You come in and this is where you're 
supposed to feel. A hundred percent safe in your own home. 


Okay, talk to me a little bit more than if you are there any others that kind of stick out 
to maybe not the absolute top needs since I'm only letting you have one, but some other 
needs that are pretty high up there. 


Well, Yes. So it would. All seem to ensure that myself and other. Field. Safe and 
protected. That one. And why I touch on that is because. You're meeting people and you do 
not know who people are. And you do go in you don't. There's nobody system. But I always 
make sure I let them know it's on my calendar. I'm meeting this person. At what time? Where 
am I going to be. And whenever I'm finishing with a Tour, I always. Set a text out that I 
am. Finished and I'm leaving the property now. And that's what you would want, because as I 
said. You just never know. Who. Is. Who You're meeting. You just don't know. So that's one 
of the scenarios, the other thing, too, would be. Make the task that I complete on a daily 
basis, easier to do. Right now, every chocolate I do is quite. You know. Very sufficient. I 
make sure that everything is done. As I said, the program that we're using is phenomenal. 
So everything is set down on you on a daily task. The. These help us to. Identify. To save 
money and increase efficiency. With that. I'm a firm believer that or ever you can call 
costs. You can. I was into sustainable. So I think that a lot of things that you can 
sustain. Electricity. You know. How do you change the ball? Make sure you have the right 
type of bulbs. Make sure your water. You're not running your water. You turn your lights 
off. 

If you don't have to. If you can walk because we're the we're all properties are it's easy 
for you to walk different areas so. That would be. Great. The other thing that for me is to 
help us. 

Communicate with you know, with a team with and with the residents easier. Our 
communication. I believe that is really fantastic, because. No matter what you do everyone 
knows you. And it's easy. And they're very friendly. They'll come up and they'll talk to 
you. There is a problem. They will actually reach out. Just like sending a text. If 
something needs to be done, you can always send a text through their portal. Let them know 
what's going on. If we're having really bad weather or something will not be able to come 
up or if we'll have a freeze warning or anything, we send it through communication. And 
everyone gets it. Make it help us make our buildings like a community. It is. That is. Very 
good because. No matter where you are, if you live in an apartment complex or you live in a 
single family home. You just you know, everyone here should be able to look out for each 
other. No matter if I don't know and you're passing each other every day. So if something 
happens I'm sure you know you know 


and then help us. Help us retain our existing residents, which is extremely important 
because you 


know, you become a family, at least is a year. You know, you're like you want to retain. 
You want to renew there. You want to make sure that everything is quite okay for them here, 
for them to stay and then help us to attract new residents. Is our last one. So what we do 
for that is just that whenever anyone moves out. We do schedule tours. And we do advertise 
a property. And you know, we do a move move up in Spectrum, make sure that the property is 
quite okay for everything. And then we move in from there. Gotcha. 


So if you kind of take a step back and look at you know how you sorted we have at the very 
top. What you need the most is to ensure your residents feel safe and protected, 


right? 


And then working your way down to what you could live without is that help to attract and 
retain residents. Is there anything that you want to kind of rearrange? 


Yes, I would. Wear age because I do need my residence. So 


what would you like to shift around. 


I would make. The chassis. I complete easier to do. To retain up there. 


Okay, so swap these completely. Okay. 


And. Help us try new. I have to do. There's so many other things. I mean, it's. Right. Cuz. 
Like for instance, I help us to attract new residents, which is very important because. 
But. I do need that. But help us to identify. Save money and increase efficiency. We need 
that too. So I would actually swap. Communication is important. Vicar billing. That's 
important either. Everything here is actually very important. I know it's hard. It is very 
hard. To swap, but I help us identify optimization. To save money and increase efficient 
efficiency. We're only doing that so we can put that up there. 


Gotcha. All right. Thank you for that. And that top one does that still feel like. An easy 
decision. 


I mean, I've talked about me now. That's how fun. He's very important. Because as I said, 
it. Resident comes in. They need to be safe and protected no matter where they are, where 
they live. They do need to eat. They do need to feel safe and protected 


for sure. Thank you. I know it's so hard when you're like, no, they're all important. I 
want them all. So thanks for sorting them with me. I do have another sorting activity for 
you. 


Of course 


I apologize ahead of time. This instead of kind of needs, what we're going to be looking at 
is a list of potential features that adt could add into the product experience. And so what 
I'll have you do is sort these features. But this time we have three different categories. 
So we have. Candy, where maybe this feature brings temporary joy. But in the long run, it 
doesn't have meaningful benefits. Or would this feature be a vitamin, meaning that it'll 
make things better, but it's not essential. Or would this feature be a painkiller? Meaning 
it would solve a painful problem? 


Sure. 


So what we'll do is we'll kind of read through each feature at a time, and then you talk to 
me about which category you would place it in, and why. 

I'll Zoom in. Alright. So this first feature we have is residents receive Proactive 
notifications with recommendations based on their behavior. For example. On average, three 
lights remain on without any motion from 830 to four. Maybe create an out for the day 
routine. 


For that one. I'm sorry Can I see though can be vitamin 


candy? Vitamins pink. Temporary joy, but not necessarily meaningful benefit vitamins, 
making things better, but not essential and then painkillers. It solves for a painful 
problem. 


Well, I would do. I'm sorry. I would put that one in Benjamin. It would make. It easier. I 
think that with that being said. 

For you know, as a example of light, I just think that it would be. Beneficial because. 
Everyone needs everyone needs to have everything on so with emotions going on and so forth. 
I mean. Would it make things better. It would Is it essential. Not to that extent. 


Gotcha. All right. So the other another feature we have is your team. So I'm talking about 
you and your staff. Your team enjoys using the dashboard because the experience is easy to 
use and beautiful. 


I will put it through. To the paint co because it is very central. You do need your 
dashboard for anything. You that's what makes that's what solves problems as what you need 
your that's how your everyday. That's your everyday life. That's what you use to make sure 
that everyone. On the same page 


gotcha. Alright so we have residents are able to monitor energy and water usage for their 
unit and receive notifications about that usage. 


We don't really have that here. We don't. So. I would actually put it down on. The paint 
job because it would solve because I know that. Someone had actually mentioned that. Had 
actually wanted to know why. They're. Utility billows extremely high for where they are so 
that's. 


Right now they can't see that information. Got it. Okay. Okay. Another feature potential 
feature is residents can shop for and add new devices. Preapproved by your team. So these 
are the Smart Tech devices. 


Unfortunately, we don't do that here. Whatever you whatever is here. 


This is just kind of. Yes. This were an option. How you would feel sure it would be candy. 


It would be the candy. Brings temporary jaw, but it's not. It would not be. It sounds hard 
to say, but not meaningful at this point, because. We don't really offer it here. So we 
don't offer to any of. Properties. 

Single family homes, but they have to get a preapproval. 


Got it. Okay. Residents have enhanced routine options, like whether driven routines or ones 
based on who is home. 


I would say vitamins. Because. Yeah. I don't really have anything to say about that. It 
would make life so much easier if they are able to look at their dashboard, see what was 
going on. And even away from home at home or so forth. But 


okay. So like if they're driving home. In snowy weather. Their home is already starting to 
warm. 

All right. So another feature of residents can set up other home utilities through their 
ADT IoT app so they could set up their electric or their Internet provider through that 


that would be I would put that for Painkill because that would solve the problem for 
everyone. Instead of so many places that you have to go, you can make just do it on one 
board. 


Gotcha. All right. Your team has access to industrywide and marketwide data related to 
multifamily homes. 


It would be the pain. Solving a problem 


gotcha and right now how do you get access to that type of information. 


Actually. Through apollo, to our dashboard. 


And what kind of what kind of I'm curious. Kind of what data. They showed you know that's 
valuable for you and your staff. 


It's hard for me to explain. It just matter showing, but I'm not able to but. It shows. A 
lot of information. As I said it goes step by step. 

I'm not sure whoever range, but whoever is familiar with app Folio as a resident or as a 
property management company. It is one of the most as I said, it's one of those easiest 
tool they have. Every aspect you can think of. Where the market is going, how the rental 
market is going, how this is. But this is only for. Rentals for. So it shows a lot of data. 
That you never expected to show but it does anything that you need. Back to where you need 
to go to 


gotcha. All right, property staff can communicate with residents and other team members via 
an app. 


Yeah, I really believe it should go to the Painkill of it solve the problem so you can 
send. Once they download that app. You should be able to get anything because I do have the 
Apple. I have the app on my phone. And. I'm a resident text or something is going on. It's 
easy. So we're easy. It's quick for us to do what we have to do in real time. Not wait like 
five weeks. Just in case. Someone is doing something. And something needs to be done in 
merge as any emergency. 


Okay gotcha so being able to have that kind of onthego 


yes beneficial. 


Timely alerts. Okay. Residents enjoy using the app because the experience is easy to use 
and beautiful. 


Painkiller. Everyone enjoys using the app. There's an app on the phone. There's an app that 
you can control near. Your. Smart lock your light, your. Ac. Means everyone is doing it 
now. 


Awesome. Alright. Your team has access to property specific data insights that help 
determine your property health. 


Yes, that would be the painkiller. 


And talk to me about why this falls under painkiller. 


Because for. The team the team needs to as you know, whatever is going on with your with 
your development, with your properties or anything. It needs. You need to have access to it 
as quickly as possible. So. Data. Any data. You know, if you know that someone is something 
that's going on, you can check if someone you know something is stolen or anything. I mean, 
you need to know what your properties, what's happening under your property. At any time in 
the day. So as quickly as possible too 


gotcha. All right. And then we also have your team can receive eventbased alerts, like 
there was a lot water leak in this unit, or there's been a break in. 


Yes. So it would be Painkill because. As with that app, if you have an app that can alert 
you with what is going on, you should. Be you should be okay. 


Gotcha are there any features. Potential features that you can think of that would be 
beneficial, that we maybe haven't included. 


No, not at this time. 


All right. So I want us to kind of step back. We have, you know, just a little bit of candy 
that in terms of, you know, adding on additional devices. In terms of residents, kind of 
having additional, you know, recommendations or routines. And then when it comes to kind of 
a lot of the. Kind of functional things like the utilities for residents and then as well 
as kind of property staff. It seems like there's a lot there to kind of help solve some 
problems. Right now do you feel like you have. Like a solution for these problems that are 
here listed. 


Well. We do have a solution. And as I said. Once you know. The program that we use. Is. 
Real time. So anything that happens, we're able to. We're able to. Get you know, solve the 
problems, solve the issue or or anything. So we do you know. Our programs have been very, 
very effective. 


Awesome. That's always good to hear that those painful problems are being solved. And so 
then looking, I have one last sorting thing if we think about, you know, these three 
categories, candy, vitamins, painkillers. If you had to put iot's adt into one of these 
categories. Is it candy for you where it provides temporary joy, but in the long run, no 
meaningful benefits? Is it a vitamin where it makes things better but isn't essential? Or 
is it a painkiller where it falls for a painful problem. 


The paint are I think that it would work very well once they have all their. You know, 
whatever information that they have, as I said, I don't know if they have an app, but if 
they don't work on an app, get all this, you know. A folio. Mirror with the rental 
community. 


Yeah. Thank you. Well, before we close, I'm gonna go ahead and stop sharing. I appreciate 
you. You know, sorting all that talking through it. I am gonna. Just pause and ask if any 
of our observers have any questions before we finish up. 

Alright, well, I have just one last question for you before I let you get back to your busy 
day. If you had to leave us with one piece of advice as we continue to try to improve the 
iota's adt experience, what advice would you leave us with. 


Listen to your. Clients. That's wanda, the most important things. And whatever advice that 
they give you, you know, you explore it because at the end of the day, it's your product. 
And you want to make sure that this product goes. Beyond. As I said, I've not had a problem 
with it at all for a few weeks that we had it. I thought it was very, very full. It was 
really friendly user product. But any advice if as I said, I don't know if you have an app. 
They didn't give me an app. But if you have an app, if you develop an app. Give it to the 
resident so they're able to use it. They have a dashboard or they can go in. They can. Away 
from home. They can do their. Ac unit. They can lock their door. You know whatever it is. 


Got you. Thank you. And I know I said last question. I have one follow up. When you're 
talking kind of about an app, I know you kind of talked about residents, you know, wanting 
them to have access to an app, to be able to kind of take care of those things. In terms of 
the. Tasks that you need to complete in that property dashboard from you know, a staff's 
perspective. Is that something where kind of the property dashboard as is kind of helps 
handle everything that you need or when you talk about an app. Is that something where. 
That would be beneficial for the property staff as well. Or are you thinking about property 
staff as well. 


As it's like. For instance. Where I used to I'm sorry to bring me in but where I used to 
live. I was I had a smart lock and it allowed me. I had an app on my phone so I know that I 
can go in, I can check my dashboard if I'm away from home, if someone is actually at my 
door. I can. It's not, but you know, I can see. Whatever it is. Whoever's there if 
somebody's trying to actually do so positive someone is trying to try my door. It would 
give me a buzz. It would actually buzz me. I tell me that somebody's actually at my door. 
So I had, you know, I had the doorbell, the ring. But I also had the smart lock. So someone 
was going, something was going on. I know you wouldn't arm me someone's trying my thing. I 
know. And then I can check to see the on my ring. You know who it is. But. That's it. 


Thank you so much. 


Again. 


Appreciate you meeting with us and we'll let you get back to your day. 


Thank you so much. You have a great day. 


Yes, you too. Bye.
 
Jessica interview:
Alright, well, to begin with, I love it if you could tell me a little bit about what a 
typical work week looks like for you. 


That is a loaded question. 


I know I feel like the word typical probably doesn't work in your field, but I'd love to 
hear it anyway. 


It's a little bit of everything. I'm a community manager here, so a large portion of my 
daily tasks is managing everything. Like financials, I have a lot of reporting I have to 
pull regularly, a lot of communicating with our vendors. As far as invoicing and work we 
have scheduled and verifying statements we have. And then there's also capital projects we 
have going on, so making sure that we're ahead on that while also updating that in several 
different trackers. I get regular requests from my regional manager. As far as things to 
do, I am helping support a couple of other properties. I have an assistant manager and a 
leasing agent, so making sure they have everything they need to complete their 
responsibilities. So still making sure to monitor where we're at with renewals, rent, 
collection, leasing, how many prospects we have coming in, what our Occupancy percentages, 
what's projected so we can make sure we're in line with marketing and follow ups. And then 
of course, there's the maintenance side. Making sure the same is in place for our 
maintenance team. They have all the supplies they need, they aren't having any issues with 
ordering, scheduling, that our move ins are on track. A little bit of everything. 


Yeah, I was going to ask kind of what routine do you have or what disrupts your standard 
routine? I'm curious if you even kind of are able to have a routine with all the many 
things on your plate. 


I wouldn't say it's like a set routine because things can change every day. I'll always 
have things noted out that are must do or priority for every day of the week. And then 
whatever other projects we have going on or anything on property. Like this week, we have 
irrigation work being done so we have a water shut off tomorrow, so getting those notices 
out digitally yesterday and then getting flyers printed so we can handle it to every door 
today so that will change it. And then there's any kind of resident issues that come 
through it's, handling those, of course, by priority to try to get those resolved so your 
residents aren't unhappy with you. But I have set things that I have to do every day and 
then monitor throughout the day and then some that are on specific days through the week 
and then just kind of juggling that with whatever else is going on in the attitude. 


Well, I'm curious what you find the most rewarding about your job. 


Yeah, sorry. My sister's background. Honestly, I have a really strong team right now, so I 
think them feeling happy to come to work and then feeling successful in what they do is the 
most rewarding because anything I can do to help them get to that point is important to me. 
We also I don't want it to sound cocky, but we're like the best property in our Ohio region 
as far as performance wise, so we always get a lot of shout outs from our regional and that 
aspect. So that's always really rewarding for all of us here that our work is being 
noticed. So I'd say that's probably the main thing. 


Yeah, I mean, understandable. I'm curious, what are the particular stats that they look at 
for that type of thing? Like what data is important to you. 


How we manage our expenses versus our income, how our Occupancy is, what our lease 
retention is. 

They're huge on reviews, so we get reviews through a lot of different platforms, so our 
reputation is a big one. So we have a lot of really great reviews that come in pretty 
regularly for us. Like, our Google Score is in great standing, so there's certain 
compliance things we have to follow as far as everything with financials and our Invoicing 
and POS system and our vendor compliance. So we get graded on a lot of different things 
every month. It's like a monthly scorecard of where we stand. So those are being evaluated 
regularly. 


Got you. Yeah, well, and I'm curious, with the flip side, obviously there's rewarding parts 
of your job. What would you say are the most challenging or what is the most challenging 
part of your job? 


Having issues that are totally out of control, that I have to take responsibility for 
because I'm the manager. There are some things that you can always fix for people and there 
are some people that you can never make happy and some things that are just rent increases 
because the market changes and we all get rent increases. So I think that can be sometimes 
difficult because some people are very understanding and logical and some are just here to 
yell at you. So I think that's probably the most frustrating part. I can only control so 
many things and of course I have my massive set of things that I'm regularly evaluated on, 
but it's a little difficult to I can't control what anybody else does. So I think it's just 
sometimes there's always logical explanations, but sometimes it's just being evaluated by 
straight data and we just have to be able to back it up. So I think that can be pretty 
frustrating sometimes, but it's a few and far between, I'd say. 


Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I'm curious, I know you mentioned like, regional managers 
and then you have your staff, you have residents. I'm curious kind of who you communicate 
most frequently with when you're at work. 


I am talking with my assistant and my leasing agent all day, every day. Same with my 
service manager. They're in here regularly, like our service team members. And then as far 
as positions above me. I hear from my regional manager almost daily, and then she'll come 
and do on site visits at least once or twice a month because she's local, but we're in 
constant kind of contact. 


Got you. Awesome. And then do you ever have any communication, like with the building owner 
operator today? 


What do you mean? 


Is your communication with kind of the owner, the management of the property? Is that 
through the regional? 


Kind of the regional. She has like seven different properties in Ohio that she oversees. So 
she'll get communication coming down from more like the corporate home office, like the Bps 
and director of operations and a lot of different positions. So any kind of feedback or 
news that she's getting from them or policy changes or whatever gets filtered through her 
to then explain to her community managers in her region. And then we of course, deliver 
that further if needed. 


Got you. Okay, well, and then with all of the different things you're juggling and all the 
different reports you have to run and things you have to keep track of, what are some tools 
that you use at work? And, like, if there's specific program names or app names that you 
use, I'd love to kind of know what those specific tools are that you use. 


Yeah, we use all real page products. One side is our main system, but we also use 
SharePoint, which a lot of different companies use is like a shared folder section. So my 
regional has certain items I have to do regularly that she has in her section. And I have 
to keep updated reports of every week, month, year organized for our property and our 
SharePoint. They did start using Smart Sheet last year, which is more so everybody on the 
corporate level, anybody in asset management can always see where we're at with capital 
projects as well as just like operational ones. So that will give you a way to really 
conveniently keep updated notes about where projects stand, attach bids, photos, see the 
budgeted amounts, geo codes, everything is kind of laid out for it there. So I would say 
those are the huge ones. I personally make a lot of Excel spreadsheets to track individual 
things. So I have one for move out and one for renewals and one for renovation units. So I 
can know every detail about every renovation. I have a mate ready tracker that I made just 
through excel. So I would say that's the main source of all of the organization here. 


Got you. And talk to me about if any of those particularly help you succeed or if any of 
them particularly frustrate you when you use them. 


They 100% help. I couldn't function without them. We have some properties, a lot of 
properties that don't use anything to track their renewals as far as what their feedback is 
with residents, about their intentions or where those stand, as far as what's pending. 
Because there's reports you can pull, but you can't see details about who's called you've, 
talked to you've, emailed, what rates or terms have been discussed. So every single one 
that I have absolutely serves a purpose. Same with SharePoint and smart sheet. Those are 
super valuable tools for us and for every community that uses those. 


Got you. So if you had to rate it on a scale of one to five, where one is much worse and 
five is much improved, how improved is your day to day work life based on the technology 
that you have supporting you? 


500%? 


Yeah. Awesome. Well, I'm going to kind of shift gears. It was helpful to kind of get some 
general context of all the things that you have to kind of balance and juggle and what 
tools you use to do that. And so kind of before we really jump into details, I want to 
better understand kind of how you think about Iotas and ADT. So in your own words, could 
you kind of describe the IoTis ADT products that you're building uses? 


So we took over this community almost two years ago, and the previous management company 
installed the Smart Tech locks and app function for like half the property. I've never had 
it at another community I've worked at. I think ADT recently acquired or merged with Iotas 
in the past year. Is that correct? 


Oh, sorry, did you? Yes, they've merged. 


Okay. So I haven't noticed any difference with Ad since ADT has come on board with it. 
I've, of course, have had ADT in the past. There are alarm systems. They do our door codes 
for our residents, for our gym. So I've not had any issues with ADT other than the ability 
or the functionality of them actually uploading their own invoices instead of me having to 
go to manually pull them every month, because we have a whole technology system for online 
invoicing. So that's my only downside with ADT. Iotas I've never worked with before, and to 
put it bluntly, they're the worst vendor I've ever worked with. As far as having a service 
for your residence, that's terrible to work with. I wish I could uninstall it. 


Talk to me more about that. I want to know more about why it is that way for you. 


I get that it's an additional feature for residents. Some like it because they like having 
the same code entry on top of having a key. Some people like having the app function to 
lock their door, change their thermostat terminal light, whichever. But as far as in 
office, it is one entirely other thing to manage where you don't really get any support 
from Iotas themselves. Everything is sent back to the office. So you have this dashboard to 
see who's registered, like, who has the Smart Tech system, who's registered and who's not. 
And it's like 40% of people didn't even register with the product. They just have it and 
use the door code but they don't even care about the rest of the app functions, which is 
fine. I would rather than just have the Pin code system than have to worry about the app 
working or not working. A lot of times they aren't able to actually create their own door 
code when they should be able to. So then that's another work order for our guys to go and 
set up a door code for them. The alert system on there is constant notifications about low 
batteries. I do not have the time and neither does my team to go in and monitor regularly. 
Oh, the battery is running less than 20% and needs replaced. That's 25 additional work 
orders in a month just to change battery for an app that nobody truly seems to care about. 
Every time we have something malfunction, it is a back and forth. Me constantly following 
up, trying to get follow up on when I can get equipment, where I can get it. A lot of times 
I've just sent a link to go get it off of Amazon. I have three residents still with issues 
that have had four months that we tried multiple things and then they're like I'll research 
it for you and then never get back to me. So I have to keep reaching out. I have a smart 
hub that is from November that I still haven't gotten the invoice uploaded for correctly 
and it took two months just to get. I have so many feelings, torture that need to be 
negative. But I've had the worst time with it. And it's really frustrating because 
residents have this, and then when they have problems, it comes to us because we're the 
ones that have to get resolution for them. And if they call support, they reach out to us 
to send our maintenance guy out and do a live call and schedule a time. And then we usually 
have to buy product. If anything was more digital and more remotely controllable, like 
helping somebody create their door code and having more actual troubleshooting and quicker 
response from Iota support, then maybe I wouldn't feel that way, but it's been not 
enjoyable at all. 


Got you. And with all the kind of the troubleshooting and things that kind of land on your 
staff's role, how prepared do you feel to kind of handle the requests or the concerns that 
come up versus needing for you to go turn to support to get help? 


Well, if it's anything to do with their door code not working or of course the battery and 
the actual smart lock is dead, that's easy. We can send our guys over, we got this 
instructions from the website about how to change the code, whichever, so they can do that. 
But if it's like my door sensor isn't acknowledging when my door is shut or open and then I 
try to do the few things that are suggested from support like buying a magnet and sticking 
the magnet to the door or something. And of course that doesn't work. And then I have a 
sensor that doesn't work, and then I have nowhere to go until they tell me. I'll submit a 
request to see if we can get that replaced. And who knows how long that will be. And I'll 
have to follow up, of course. And then it's a matter of, well, how do I get it if it's 
through Amazon or if they purchase it, and then I have no idea how long it's going to take. 
You don't get any kind of shipping updates. And then invoicing is a huge part of what I'm 
constantly having to monitor and I'm evaluated on. So if I have no idea when I'm going to 
get invoiced for a $500 Smart Hub, that's a problem. 


Yeah, understandable. And I'm curious. I know you said when you guys kind of took over this 
property, it had already been installed. Talk to me about kind of what that training 
process was for using Iota, if there was any at all. 


There wasn't. It was here's the login for the website, super easy to manage. And then that 
was it. I mean, takeovers. You're kind of here and they do a 20 minutes rundown of we call 
it like the bible of all the logins and contact information and some general information 
you're going to need to know. So of course we create the login. And we had a couple of 
calls with Iota as far as, like, this is what the dashboard is and these are what those 
sections mean and what you should be looking out for. And you should be changing the master 
locks for the entire property or master codes. Excuse me. So it's kind of like as that came 
out, it was like, oh, this is actually a whole lot more involved than it originally seemed. 
And everything since then has kind of just been seeing whatever information is actually on 
the website as far as the support section, because we'll be like, oh, we need a new Smart 
Lock, and then be like, oh, did you check the support section on the website? And I'm like, 
yes, obviously. That's why I'm emailing you, to make sure we're getting the right thing. A 
lot of it come from that, honestly. I know a portion of it. It would have been nice to have 
a better idea of what that actually entails and how the previous management company managed 
this. But it's way more than any of us thought that it was and never thought it would be so 
difficult to just get, like, equipment. 


Yes, understandable. And I'm curious oh, go ahead. 


I was just going to say there's a cost to all of that equipment too. So I don't know how 
long this equipment is either going to be good for. I don't know how to budget over the 
next year, how much we're going to potentially have to replace, because I have no idea what 
the quality or lifespan of it is. 


Yeah, understandable. I'm curious if there's anything what if anything could have been done 
differently in order to kind of make that easier to learn how to use the products, get 
familiar with what's involved, how long they last, that type of thing. 


I think potentially just what the expectation or requirement is as far as like daily or 
weekly managing it. Because as you can tell, we have a lot going on all the time in every 
role. So to have another aspect of it that is something that needs regularly audited and 
checked and making sure it's working would have been helpful. But we all are so used to 
having new programs all the time and things changing all the time, so we all have to adapt 
quickly and we're used to that and can do that. But I think just having it be this isn't 
just residents getting a login and when they move in and they have to register and then 
they'll have access to this app, it's like, that's not it. It's actually a lot more to it 
and you can't do anything remotely. It's all like hands on and having to jump through hoops 
to get supplies if anything breaks. 


Got you. So just to make sure that I'm understanding, it sounds like that initial resident 
where it's like, okay, set your door code up, that seems to be okay. It's more the 
troubleshooting with alerts or equipment or that type of thing. Am I understanding that 
right? 


I would say from what we hear from residents, we get a lot of questions about like, hey, 
how do I set this up? So they're not getting a lot of information as far as set up, we'll 
tell them move in or what to expect, but they don't always have their internet equipment on 
day one. So it's like, well, you have to have your internet and then you have to hook 
everything up to it before you can connect to it. But you should get this email. So 
actually you might want to search in your email for this request to create a login. I think 
we have the function to resend the link, but there's not really much else we can do from 
that point. So some people seem to have issues just getting it to work and then when we get 
them through that point, some of them have issues with like, well, it's still saying, I'm 
offline, what else can I try? So we will still recommend call the other support line, see 
if they can walk you through it and then if needed, let us know. And a lot of times it 
still comes to us or they'll immediately be told to come to the office. The opposite of 
what we're trying to do, for sure. 


And I'm curious, I know you said we're used to getting new tools thrown our way. We're used 
to having to pick up new programs. I'm curious kind of like, what makes the difference for 
you and your staff for a new tool being useful versus a new tool being one more thing to 
do. 


Every time they change something or launch something new, it's always presented and trained 
with, these are the benefits for you. This is what's going to make it easier for you or 
better for you or better for your residents. Whereas there's not a lot of ways to see the 
benefit in something where you're like, well, this is like just an additional task. This is 
just more for me to do. But nobody's really getting a lot of benefit from it. 


Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Well, and I'm curious, if there were changes that could be 
made, would there be any changes that could be made to Iota ADT where it would benefit you, 
it would benefit your staff, and what would those be? 


I feel like, if anything, it just as far as the return on it, we only charge $20 uptick 
when we call them tickets for this particular amenity. So, of course, over time, that can 
add up and that can help your income. But it needs to be more where there is quick 
turnaround for assisting residents and having more. That's like helping with digital set 
up, instead of being, we need to create a work order, schedule time to meet with you and go 
set up this code, like our ADT doors for our residents, for the gym amenities, everything. 
All of that is digital. We just create the code. If they forget it, we can easily reset it. 
They have access, no issue. But that's a big problem as far as accessibility, if they have 
any problems with it, or they just need to change the code because they don't want somebody 
they gave it to have it anymore. I think too. As far as product, if there is something that 
needs replaced, we're getting accurate information on if it needs replaced and what does it 
need to be replaced with. So we have easy access to go and actually order an. Item. Instead 
of waiting for somebody to say, let me see if I can get approval, and then waiting two 
months and not knowing if you're ever going to get it. So a lot of our vendors, we use Ops 
technology, like I mentioned, with Real page and everything is online invoicing, but our 
vendors also can set up their own catalogs for products. So, like our flooring or painters 
office. Macs HD supply for everything, maintenance equipment. If it was something that was 
more like, we can easily go in and add this to our order and just ship it to us and we get 
it. Maybe a couple of weeks, that would make more sense because it shouldn't take so long 
to just get a door lock or to get a smart hub and we have a move in who doesn't have their 
smart hub for two plus months. So if it were easier access to actually, you know, once we 
troubleshoot and figure out what we need to actually get the equipment or just place the 
order, that would make a lot more sense rather than having to just make sure. I remember 
when the last time I sent this email and I still haven't heard back. I should send another 
email. 


Got you. So it sounds like the most kind of efficient ordering and that invoicing that you 
do is kind of when it's integrated with that smart ops that you have. Okay. Got you. And so 
right now, it's kind of a completely separate process to be able. 


To okay, yeah, just repeat emails and hoping for the best. 


Got you. Yeah, no, I can understand why that would be frustrating. I'm also kind of 
curious, are there benefits that you are seeing to the residents that having Iota ADT is 
bringing today? 


A no? 


All right, what about kind of any benefits that you wish that they would be able to offer 
in the future? 


Honestly, I don't really know. It's not really a selling point for us. It's like, oh, this 
apartment happens to have this additional feature. And some people are like, oh, that's 
cool, and some are like, oh, yeah, I mean, that's fine, I'll have it. But if I don't, it 
doesn't matter. In the time we've been here, I don't really notice that residents seem to 
care a lot. Of course, like, some people are more technically inclined than others, so they 
like having the app. But majority of people don't seem to really mess with the app features 
at all. They just use the Pin code for their door entry. 


Got you. And is kind of increased resident usage something that is valuable to you and your 
staff at all? 


I think it would only be valuable in a sense, to me to see like, oh, we have this 
additional feature and people actually care to have it. Because I know there are some 
communities that are like, oh, we're installing it for our entire community. And I'm like 
but why? Like, you do have that additional extra little bit of income, which every 
community is always looking like, oh, how can we change this? Or what can we add? Or what 
would be the benefit if we add this thing? But I don't know if I'm sure things that are 
being installed now are probably more updated and things have changed and improved since 
whatever was installed here. But think too, our maintenance team doesn't know how all of 
these things were installed. They don't know how these specific outlets were selected and 
set up to be connected to the app. So we don't know what to do if something doesn't work. 
We don't have a local tech that can come out and check it for us. So I think a lot of it is 
assumed that we can just figure it out, which we can figure out a lot of things, but it's 
kind of frustrating to not have quick resolution for your residents if it's something they 
feel like they want to use. But I rarely hear from people talking about it other than 
something not working. 


Got you. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And especially having kind of moved in with it 
already installed. Were there any records or any information to kind of give some of that 
information about the reasons behind the choices or this outlet? It's controlled by the 
app, but this one isn't. Do you kind of have any of that information? Okay. No. 


The only thing that we were given was a list of every address that has it and what their 
registered master code was. 


Got you. And I'm curious. I know we've been kind of talking about benefit or not benefit to 
the resident. I'm curious in terms of kind of for you from the more property management 
side, what information about your residence or your building do you find valuable that you 
receive from Iota ADT today, if any? 


Honestly, I think the only thing I've ever noticed on the dashboard is if it says, like, 
there's a temperature alert, like, the temperatures drop below x amount of degrees. So that 
way we know, because every time somebody moves out or as we're turning an apartment, we're 
checking the thermostat anyways. We make sure if it's in the winter, it's set onto heat and 
vice versa. So I think that's the only time I've seen an alert where I'm like, oh, that's 
helpful in case we've missed it. So we can call a resident and say, like, hey, we noticed 
your temperature is really low in your apartment. Did you turn off your heat or you out of 
town? But that's the only thing I've ever seen where I'm like, oh, that's helpful if it 
comes up, but it's been really rare that it does. 


Got you. And so how frequently do you kind of go to the Iota dashboard? Is it part of your 
kind of rhythm of checking, or is it kind of hidden? 


Not at all. The only time I check it is if I get an email that's, like, this device is 
offline, which always happens after a move out, or if I get something like a temperature 
gate. It's only happened a few times. 


Okay. 


That's the only time you get an. 


Email in your email, and that's what prompts the going into the okay. 


Yes. 


Is there any information about your residence or buildings that you would find valuable if 
I ought to ADT could find a way to provide it? 


Not really, because the function itself is just for the resident access. It doesn't really 
do anything for us. We always have a hard copy key or work orders. Our guys don't go over 
and enter in the master code because they have to pull out a whole spreadsheet and figure 
out what. Number it is. Yeah. So I don't think there's really anything that would make it 
more valuable for us. 


Got you. And so, right now, just so I understand what those work orders, are your 
maintenance staff using, like, the hard key, or are you giving them kind of like, the code 
to use for that particular unit? 


The hard key. 


Okay. 


And if for any reason they're like, oh, this key doesn't work, it happens to be a smart 
lock, like, what's the master code? Then they would pull that list and buy the master code, 
but they don't reference that at all. 


Got you. 


And they don't keep anything, like, recorded on their phones or whichever. So it's all like 
paper copy or an Excel sheet to try to look through to find it. So they almost never use 
that unless it's to help a resident reset their code. Got it. 


Okay, I want to shift a little bit just in terms of you talked about how you guys have ADT 
for a lot of the access controls and with Iota was recently purchased by ADT. I'm curious, 
thinking about ADT's history for with security, that type of thing, if there are any 
benefits that you see with Iotas becoming part of ADT, I. 


Think when I heard about it, what I think would be a benefit if it happens is everything 
just kind of gets more updated to be more digital control. Like I said, ADT, we can go on 
and set everything electronically. I almost never use the panels in our office because I 
have everything on a schedule. All of our resident codes we can set up within seconds. It's 
all within our desktop reach, and it's quick and easy. They're dashboards. I don't often go 
into the ADT dashboard unless I get an alert, but I go into it once a month to always pull 
the invoice because it's not uploaded digitally for me, like we would prefer. But I think 
in my head, I'm hoping that things kind of update. And I feel like support with ADT is 
definitely better because if I call and have an issue, I usually have somebody out within a 
day, two days maybe, and it's an actual technician on site to troubleshoot and tell me what 
the problem is or if something needs ordered so we can get it fast. So I'm hoping that will 
change with the acquisition because Iodis doesn't provide any of that. 


Yeah, understandable. Are there any risks that you see with Iota becoming part of ADT? 


No. 


Okay. 


Not at all. 


And I'm curious, as we're thinking about all these smart tech features, what role do you 
see security playing with smart technology, if any? 


You mean like the benefit of having smart tech in terms of security for the residents? 


If you see it as a benefit or if it plays an additional role for you from a property 
management standpoint? Just kind of what that combination? How you see that? Working. 


I don't know. I see more of the smart tech as far as lock systems in that I just see it as 
more of a backup. Not like something that should be the sole provider of securing the 
apartment. Because say somebody comes home and they have a smart tech and the battery is 
dead and their pin code doesn't work and they don't have a key because they're like, oh, I 
have this pin code, I don't need a key. But you do. Like you should always still have your 
apartment key on you. But the pin code can be like a quick ease of access or if you give it 
to somebody else, so they don't need a physical key copy. But to me it's always and I've 
been renting for twelve years, I still rent, so I don't have it where I live. But I would 
always still see it as just a backup. I think it's nice that people leave and they're like, 
I don't know if I locked my door. Kind of like how you can do that with a lot of neighbor 
cars. Now I don't know if I locked my car. Let me go to my app real quick and I'll make 
sure I locked it. It's nice to have that feature for your home in case, just to give you 
some peace of mind and know that it's secured. But to me it's never going to I don't think 
it should ever solely be the only thing there for somebody. I think it's just a benefit and 
gives a lot of people some peace of mind to be able to double check things. 


Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I know you've kind of talked about obviously the door as 
kind of this backup option. Are there any other security features that you feel like would 
be beneficial to you and your property, if any? 


We haven't a resident asked before, actually, like if the app has a function or could have 
the function to alert them when their door is opened. So if they're not at home, say they 
have a work order and they give us permission to enter, but when maintenance goes over, 
they probably still want to know like, oh, someone's in my apartment right now. So that has 
been something your residence brought up before. And I don't believe that function exists. 
We couldn't find anything. But I think that would be really beneficial so they could see 
when's my door been open, when somebody's been there, especially when people aren't at home 
or out of town, I always tend to think the worst. So I'm like, oh my God, is somebody 
there? Or did I unlock this or not? So I think that would be really beneficial because like 
with ADT I can easily pull a report or get sent an email that's like, this is your open 
door or your code access. Like this is every time someone with this code came in the gym. I 
can go and check that time report. But I think that would be really beneficial for 
residents to have so they know who's been in their apartment at what time. Maybe not who, 
but like that somebody has been in their apartment. 


Yeah, totally. Awesome. Well, this has been so helpful. I appreciate your honest feedback 
because that's exactly kind of what we're really wanting. People that have real life 
experience, it we want to know good, bad, ugly, all of it. We are going to kind of shift 
gears now and we're actually going to complete an activity together. So the goal of this 
activity is to get a better understanding of what's most important to you. So I'm going to 
have a list of needs that you might have in your job. Let me share my screen so that way as 
I talk about the next part, you'll know what I'm talking about. We have this list of 
possible needs which I'll zoom in so you can see it easier. But we have this pyramid and so 
for each of these needs, I'm going to have you tell me where on the pyramid it goes. So at 
the very top we have what you need most. You only get one of those. It's your absolute top 
need. And then the priority level goes from most important towards least important for you 
to have fulfilled at the bottom so things that you could live without. And so we also have 
the option, like if we didn't think of everything, we still can add one or two sticky notes 
if there's a need that you have that we haven't mentioned. So I'll read through them really 
quick and then I'll have you tell me where they go. We have make the tasks I complete on a 
daily basis easier to do. Help us identify optimizations to save money and increase 
efficiency. Ensure residents feel safe and protected. Ensure myself and other property 
staff feel safe and protected. Help us make our buildings feel like a community. Make 
communicating with my team and with residents easier. Help us attract new residents. Help 
us retain existing residents. Do you have any other kind of needs that you want to add to 
this before we start sorting them? 


Not that I can think of. I don't want to over complicate this. Awesome. 


Well, from those, do you kind of have a sense of what you feel like is the most important 
one for you? Out of those I can zoom back in and feel free to kind of talk out loud. If 
you're debating between two. I'd love to hear your thought process. 


I'm going to say top one. It sounds kind of like the wording of it sounds kind of weird, 
but where it says, help us make our buildings feel like a community, I think that's more in 
a sense of not just the buildings, but the residents, that they actually feel a sense of 
community here and that we are actually here to support them and that they are happy here. 
So I would say that's top second would be ensure property staff feel safe and protected and 
that residents feel safe and protected. 

Next, optimization. Save money, communicate with residents and retain existing residents. 


Okay. 


And then the other two. Yeah, those can go at the bottom. I'll always try to find ways to 
make things easier. 


I'm curious why, if that's something that I think we all love to do, like make our time, 
I'm curious how then it kind of got to the end of the pyramid for you. 


Well, with help us attract new residents, I feel like there's always going to be things 
that attract residents here. We are a very saturated area. We are flooded with apartments 
and new builds or homes. So I don't really ever have a concern with us attracting residents 
here because we get regular traffic or interest. There's not really anything additional we 
could do that we don't already do. So it's always important to of course, get new prospects 
and get them out to tour. But I don't really ever see that as something that we struggle 
with. I mean, things always slow down seasonally, but that's never something that I'm like. 
We need help with this. People don't like us, we're fine there. So that's never really a 
concern that kind of comes with it and our team being the way that we are as far as making 
tasks I complete on a daily basis easier. This is a really hard job. It's always going to 
be hard. We do as much as we can to make it as easy for us personally as possible. So 
that's never something I can rely on anybody else to provide for me or anybody else. A lot 
of it is personally what's going to help you get through your tasks and manage your own 
stuff and you kind of have to put that in place yourself. We can rely on our corporate 
team. I think our management company specifically is really great with training, so I can 
always depend on them to provide sufficient training and time. And if you need help, they 
will get you in touch with somebody who need more hands on help or just one on one. But 
that's not something I really need someone else to provide. That's more my responsibility 
and I need to figure it out. I need to make something easier how I get my job done. So 
those are still important things, but those are always going to kind of fall if your 
residents don't feel safe and your staff doesn't feel safe and you can't have anything else 
on that beer bid. 


Yeah. And so talk to me a little bit about kind of this very top one. I know you said the 
wording wasn't exactly right, so talk to me kind of about what this means to you and why it 
is the top most. 


Need I think because a lot of what falls into that is our reputation and our strength as a 
team in office and in maintenance. I've lived in not a lot of places, but I've worked in a 
handful of communities. And if your residents don't feel any sense of community, if they 
feel like they don't matter, that you don't ever communicate with them, that once they move 
in, that's it, and you don't care about their quality of living here, then you'll fail. You 
can't have anything else. So if you don't have that good relationship with your residence, 
you're always going to have someone who just doesn't like you, but it's okay. But I think 
if you already have that established and you maintain that as long as they're residents 
here, then that's only going to help you succeed, because then you'll retain more 
residents. You always expect people to move out. That's the nature of the business. That's 
how it should be. You're always 100% you're doing something wrong. But that way when things 
change, they know that you appreciate them, and if you update things, they know that you 
want to make things better for them. If they get rent increases, they're like, well, my 
maintenance team is awesome. They always come within a day, and the office team has always 
been super helpful. So I think if you don't have a resident somewhere and you don't have 
that feeling that you love where you live, then nothing else is going to go well. That's 
our side of it in every aspect that we have to do. 


Yeah, that definitely can't all be fit on a sticky, but I'm so glad to share all of that, 
and it makes sense why it's right at the top. Thank you for that. We have one other kind of 
sorting activity. What we're going to do now is I have a list of potential features that 
Iotas ADT could add into the product experience. So I have a number of categories that I 
want you to sort these features into. So would this feature be candy, meaning it has 
temporary joy, but in the long run, not really meaningful benefits? Is this feature A 
vitamin where it will make things better but it's not essential? Or is this feature a 
painkiller, meaning it would solve for a painful problem really necessary to have. So what 
I'll do is we'll read through, and as we read through each feature, tell me where you see 
each feature fitting under those. It's fun for a little bit, but not lasting. Makes things 
better, not essential, or solves for a painful problem. So the first one we have is 
residents receive proactive notifications with recommendations based on their behavior. For 
example, hey, on average, three lights remain on without any motion from 830 to four. Let's 
create an out for the day routine. 


I would say that's a vitamin. 


Okay. And talk to me why that bumps into vitamin versus candy or painkiller I. 


Think it's not uncommon for people to come in and ask about their utility bill. We use 
Pioneer Energy Management, everything's individually metered so they can log into their 
account and see their water and electric usage. But I think a lot of times, people, their 
complaint is, well, why is my bill this high when I don't have anything on? Or, I don't use 
that much power, so this should be way lower. So I think that would be something that is 
beneficial, potentially a painkiller. 


Got you. I'll put this kind of in between, mostly in vitamin. All right. Your team enjoys 
using the dashboard because the experience is easy to use and beautiful. 


You're talking about, like, in a perfect world if that were true. 


Yes, potentially. Yes. 


Okay. 


Yeah. This is dream world. This is not reality. 


That would be candy. 


Okay. Residents are able to monitor energy and water usage for their unit and receive 
notifications about usage. 


I think that would fall with the other one kind of in between killer. 


Residents can shop for and add new devices pre approved by your team. 


Candy okay. 


Residents have enhanced routine options like weather driven routines or ones based on who 
is home. Candy residents can set up other home utilities through their Iota app, like 
electric or Internet provider. 


I want to say candy because we always have specific. We set up their utilities for them, 
and they're only responsible for calling to have their cable and Internet equipment 
shipped. So it wouldn't be beneficial to integrate. 


Okay. Your team has access to industry wide and market wide data related to multifamily 
homes. 


We already have that. I guess it would depend on what kind of data it is. We have a lot of 
things kind of already in place and a website called Apartment IQ that kind of already does 
all of that for us. So I don't think that would probably provide anything. 


Okay. Because we're dreaming. Is there any data that you don't get that you would love to 
get? 


Honestly, no. I feel like I'm constantly smothered in data. 


Too much data. All right, so where would you put this one then? 


I guess candy okay. 


Property staff can communicate with residents and other team members via Nap. 


We also already have that. So our current one is a painkiller. So I guess that could go 
there like we do already use that, and that's essential. 


Okay, and which app is that that you currently use it's through Active Building. 


So it's like community Facebook events, submit work orders, pay rent. Everything is already 
kind of there. 


Got you. So where do you want to put this? Do you want to put it in painkiller since that's 
a feature that is helpful or not a feature there since it's already in pain? 


I guess it could go in the middle just because if it was something separate, it's non 
essential. 


Yeah. Residents enjoy using the app because the experience is easy to use and beautiful 
painkiller. So talk to me about why the resident experience goes into painkiller. I noticed 
the team experience goes into candy. I'm curious the difference between the two. 


Because I am not looking for anything else that we have to go on to manage and monitor and 
look at. We have so many things we already do that with that meet for our needs. But as far 
as it being a specific feature to the residents, if they want to use it, I want to make 
sure it works well for them and is user friendly for them. I could care less if it is for 
me, at least as I have to be involved in it is the goal. Got you. We don't need anything 
additional, really. Our access in my ideal world would be as minimal as possible. 


Got you. I know right now you kind of have it where it's like you get the email alerts and 
so that's when you go into it, is that kind of the level? Is that kind of working in terms 
of your involvement with it? Where you're getting an email to give you the information or 
to give you a heads up to go in there? 


Yes, I think so. Because if I log in right now, there's a ton of alerts about batteries 
that you but in my eyes, if a battery is low and a resident is suddenly like, hey, this one 
thing isn't working, can you come and do it? I'm going by resident request. I'm not going 
to call and be like, hey, your battery is starting to run low. Do you want us to come out? 
I'm doing it based off of the resident and their needs and their request for it instead of 
us trying to check it and reach out to them. Right now, it's like if we just received the 
most important alerts, like temperatures below 30 degrees in January, that's obviously bad. 
Then that's what's important to me, other than just having digital access to help with 
their door code. But as far as the resident, if they're going to have that as a feature, I 
want it to actually be user friendly and a beneficial feature for them to have. 


Got you. That makes a lot of sense. Okay. Your team has access to property specific data, 
insights that help determine your property health, vitamins. Okay. Your team can receive 
event based alerts like a water leak or a break in pain killer. Okay. And then are there 
any kind of potential features that could be added into this product experience that we 
haven't mentioned? 


No. Other than just remote access for door codes. 


Well, I'm going to put that in there, and then where would you put this? Under painkiller. 
Okay. Awesome. Sweet. I have one final kind of sorting question, and then I'm going to kind 
of open it up to see if any of our observers have any question. I think thank you for going 
through this and asking my multiple or answering my multiple follow up questions. So if you 
had to put Iotas ADT into one of these three categories, candy, vitamin or painkiller, 
which would you choose? 


Vitamin. 


Vitamin. Talk to me about why that is. 


I know I kind of started with, like, if I could uninstall it, I would for some people. I 
don't know if I would say that it would make things better, but I know some people will 
like having that as a feature and in the past have had some interest in having that as an 
additional feature, but I don't see that as a necessity or essential. Like I said, to me, 
it's always going to be a backup as far as security and, you know, having an app to control 
whether to turn your lights on or off or program your thermostat, I mean, we still have 
hands or some kind of physical ability to change thermostat or turn off a light. So I don't 
see it as essential at all. I think it's just a backup, in case you forgot, or some people 
just really like apps. I'd rather just walk over to my Thermostat and set this to just know 
that it's done. 


I know I said only one last word. I do have one more, though, because with that it sounded 
like kind of a vitamin for the resident, for Iota ADT to have the most value for you in 
your job, would it be a candy vitamin or a painkiller? 


I would say vitamin just in the sense that, like, if we're going to have it, I want us to 
be able to confidently promote it and right now we've never been able to. 


Yes, understandable. Well, I'm going to go ahead and stop screen sharing. Do any of our 
observers have any questions before we wrap up with Jessica? 


No questions. 


I just want to say thank you so much. 


This has been so helpful. Yeah, of course. 


Awesome. Well, if you had to leave us with just one piece of advice as we continue to try 
to improve the Iotas adjust, what advice would you leave us with? 


Honestly, I was actually just really glad to see that this was happening because I'm sure 
every community and probably some I'm sure have had better experiences and they love it and 
things have gone great. So I hope in whoever has volunteered to do it, they do give a lot 
of feedback. I didn't want to come in and just be negative and blast it, but I've got a lot 
of feelings towards it, if anything, when I thought, I was like, well, if I can at least 
have a conversation with somebody who actually cares about the experience and what needs 
improved and what's not worth. And hopefully it will get better because I just want it to 
be better. Like, it's not going away. We're not going to uninstall it. That's not going to 
happen, but I need it to be functional, and I need it to be functional for my residents. So 
it's a benefit. So I think just having the time to kind of give this feedback and have 
people hear it and hopefully see that as a chance to make some changes, I hope that helps, 
because I don't want it to be every time a resident comes in and it's about Iotas that 
like, I want to rip my hair out. So I'm hoping it just helps things, especially with ADT 
involved now, maybe things can become a lot more efficient. We can have it be a reliable 
vendor to contact when we have issues. I'm really hoping that my pending issues I still 
have are resolved. So that's my main advice. Hopefully, whoever else talks is giving a lot 
of honest feedback and that things happen to improve it afterwards, because it's really 
been a struggle for us, and I would like it to not be. 


Yes, understandable. I really appreciate all the context that you gave us, and like I said, 
your candor. That's definitely the goal of us speaking with people is to really we want the 
real deal, and we definitely want to improve upon the experience that you have today. But 
we'll let you get back to your day, and I will get your incentive emailed to you. But thank 
you again so much for meeting with us. This is really helpful. 


Of course. I'm always happy to help in the future if you need it. Awesome. Thank you. All 
right, thanks. 


Bye.
 
Jonathan interview:
Alright, well, tell me a little bit to begin. I would love to know what like a typical work 
week looks like for you. 


Well, we're in the middle of a lease up for this property, so it's a brand new development. 
It's the rundle at Riverview Crossing. It's in Edmonton, Alberta. We have two buildings, 
one of which is 119 units. We have everything that's rentable is now rented. We open the 
doors in August. So with like, the way things are with construction and whatnot, we've had 
a lot of like, construction delays and my days have been interesting, varied, I would say. 
Right. Just with the process of a lease up, moving everybody into a brand new building now 
coming to completion. With that building, the focus is shifting a little bit on just pre 
leasing building two, and then getting a lot of contracts and stuff set up for this 
building and just making sure things are running smoothly and then tenants are happy and 
then focusing on the pre lease for building too. So, like, typical days, like, pop into the 
office first thing in the morning. I arrived typically 830. Just, like, combing through my 
emails for the day, try to get that kind of just out of the way, and then focusing on 
catching up with any leads that are sitting and ready to go so that we can line up 
appointments, either for myself or for Vichelle, my coworker, who's our leasing agent, and 
then some visits by contractors dealing with the construction team. And then just like 
managing the warranty issues that they've been coming up. Like brand new appliances that 
are needing repairs, like warranty, stuff like that. Or some sort of deficiency in the 
suite that having to dispatch whoever. And then yeah, occasionally some meetings, some 
standing meetings, depending on the day. Wednesday seems to have a few more, the rest of 
the day is not as many. Yeah, that's about it. 


Awesome. So Eliseops is that talk to me. I'm not very familiar with property management. So 
what kind of does that mean? Do you have current residence or is this just totally new? And 
so you've been getting new residents. 


So a lease up is yeah, it's for a brand new development. So I started on the project about 
a year ago in March. At that time they had an estimated date of completion that they were 
telling me people would be able to move in for. I think we had settled on June 1 or 
something like this. So my focus at that time was purely just like finding people to rent 
these apartments. We had about well, by the time we ended up opening the doors in August, 
there was about 44 units that we had lined up that we had rented. So just a little bit 
under half that building. And then yeah, it's just finding people to lease those vacant 
units until the building is full essentially. 


Got you. And then how does your week change or your responsibilities change? Once you're 
shifting from getting new leads and new residents to where you have residents, all of your 
units are occupied, how does that kind of shift? 


Yeah, from there it becomes more of like a focus on retention as opposed to leasing. So 
doing things that keep people happy and wanting to stay in the building. There will be like 
a future focus on trying to host a lot of community events and such for the building, that 
kind of stuff that keeps people wanting to stick around. And then throughout the year, of 
course, we'll be doing inspections on people's units to make sure that we want to keep 
renting to them before their lease has come up. We're typically doing those about 120 days 
out of the time that their lease is going to come up. So depending on how many will have a 
lot more coming up in the month of September, let's say, because we had opened the doors 
last August, right? Yeah, I guess that's more the focus there would just become more 
surrounding like retention and then managing the day to day, making sure everybody's paying 
the rent every month and making sure that the building is being well taken care of. Making 
sure that all of our contractors are keeping up their ends of the bargain, showing up and 
doing what they need to do. 

The focus for me is hopes for future projects too, because the developer we're working with 
right now has another development out in Sherwood Park that we're hoping to lend the 
management contract with. So ideally I'll take on that project as well and just manage both 
buildings. 


We'll see with all your free time that you have. 


Yeah, I'm also doing school right now. 


Oh, man. 


Yeah, I got my property manager's license just near the end of last year and then I'll be 
getting right now I'm doing my real estate license from there. I'll do commercial. I'm just 
going to keep doing school until I get my brokers. 


Yeah, go for it. I'm curious, like, with all the things that you're juggling at work, do 
you have any particular tools that you use at work to make your life easier? 


Yeah, I mean, like, our CRM or like accounting type software that we're using is called 
Yardy. We recently switched to that from a previous platform that may feel management was 
using called MRI. So Yardi is kind of like on the daily Iotas. Obviously why we're here. We 
have another one that's set up for our ICT system, like the access control. So like Fob 
access and a terminal that you can use to call up to a residence. They can let you into the 
building. That's called butterfly MX. So that's another one that's used frequently today. I 
just had training because we have installed like, electronic parcel lockers through the 
company called SNAILY. So that's like outside of the regular mail delivery, which here is 
Canada post. That would be for other Amazon, like FedEx, Ups, stuff like this. So when 
their carriers come in packages and whatnot can get safely locked up and stored outside of 
that, I'm wondering if other tech that we're using daily, I like to personally use 
something to help kind of just track what's going on, a to do list, what's been done, what 
needs to get done, this kind of thing. Mayfield management was using up until very 
recently, base Camp. They recently just dropped that though. So I started an account with 
Trello that I'm just using more personally. 


On your own? 


Yeah, that works for me. That's fine. Outside of that so our intake process for 
applications and for electronic signing of paperwork, like leases and a couple of other 
documents is through a company called Onsite. Through that company, they also run our 
screenings for the applications. So we send out a link to apply for the apartment. They 
click on the link, fill out the application via on site. We review, basically make sure all 
the documents are in order to support the income and everything's kind of matching and 
lines up in terms of what information they provided on the application. Click a button, it 
runs like a credit report. Essentially, it gives us an approval rating, and then from 
there, we say, yes, it's approved. Or perhaps it needs further review. And then from there 
decide on how much of a deposit we may be collecting, if we need like a full deposit equal 
to a month's rent, or if we can still do like, a reduced deposit, which we would do 
regularly. 


Got you. So with all these different tools, which kind of overlap in terms of how they 
support your work, if they do it all. 


Yeah. Onsite is supposed to be integrating with yard. So if somebody fills an application, 
I should be seeing a guest card pop up on the yard system. So that person ends up renting 
all the information is kind of already there. Given how new Yard is, some of the 
implementations and the integrations have been a little bit slow, but that's okay. Yeah. 
Outside of that, what's, like integrating and connecting? Yeah, it's really just like on 
site and you already because the butterfly MX is very separate. Diodes is very separate. 
Obviously, SNAILY is very separate. None of those things are coming together. Right. Yeah. 


And in terms of, like, on a scale of one to five, where one is much worse and five is much 
improved, how improved is your day to day work life based on the technology you have 
supporting you? 


Well, I came from a background of working like this is my first we call it like an A class 
asset. Right. It's a new development, and we offer these kind of features that are geared 
towards connectivity for the residents and such, and we do things to focus on these 
community events. But my experience is more coming from working with our C Glass assets, 
which are older apartment buildings. They don't have any of this stuff. So really, in 
comparison, it works very well. It's definitely on the higher level. You said one to five 
to ten would be the higher. I mean, I'll give it like an eight. 


And if it was one to five, would that be a four? Would that be a five? 


Oh, I'm sorry. I misunderstood. So if you're saying one to five as opposed to, like, one to 
ten be, like, a four? 


Sure. Awesome. Well, thank you for kind of giving us that context. I'm going to kind of 
shift gears. I do want to kind of hear a little bit about kind of the Iotas products, the 
ADT products that you're building uses today. 


Okay. I don't know the name of the thermostat that's connected. I apologize for that. I'm 
not entirely sure. But I can tell you that the lock mechanism for the suites that is 
connected is their Alfred locks and then the suites also. So those two are, like, geared 
towards the residents, obviously. And then a third aspect of this is water sensors, which 
haven't really come up in any capacity as of yet. Truthfully, I don't know if they're 
installed as of yet. It's really just like the door locks and the thermostats for the 
residents. 


Got you. So it sounds like those are kind of and the residents use that through the 
resident app. 


Yeah. When we get a new resident in the building, we have access to the dashboard. They 
call it. Right. For Iota. So we just go into the dashboard and then we update the 
information for that new resident. It asks us for their name, phone number, email address, 
and then I think it's to confirm the email address and then the unit number. Right. And 
then there's already, like, a list of pre put in all the unit numbers. So it's 
automatically when we say that so and so John Smith is going to be living in unit 304. Then 
the system now knows that John Smith is in 304 and connects just as such. 


Perfect. Well, and I'm curious what your experience has been with the Iotas ADT products, 
the dashboard, those mysterious water sensors, all the other different products that you 
guys have in your building. 


Yeah, for some people it's worked really great and they haven't had any issues. And for 
other people, maybe it's never worked at all, and they've kind of just given up on it. So 
there's connectivity issues for one. Another particular issue is just with the alerts that 
come through. The low battery alerts are great, and that seems to be quite accurate. 
However, the temperature alerts that come through are, like, wildly out of whack. So I've 
never seen a temperature alert come through yet that was valid in any way. Whether it's on 
the low end of things, saying that a particular unit is very cold or even this morning I 
logged on and seen in my email that unit 606 at 11:00 p.m. Last night reached over 32 
degrees in their sweet just not a reality. Didn't happen. It's the middle of winter it's 
 18 overnight here in Canada probably below to  20 with the windshield so those have almost 
come to the point where they're just ignored. 


Really? 


Yeah. 


And are those alerts for residents or those alerts for your property they're coming. 


Through for the management company. So those alerts are coming through for us. 


Got you. What do you wish was different about Iota's ADT? 


Well, I mean outside of wishing that those sensors were working perhaps a little bit better 
customer support too. Like with the connectivity issues on some of this stuff, I've had 
like mixed experiences. So like I had a resident who had an issue, got them to call Iotas 
directly and they had an amazing experience and Iotas was like, oh, we can see this issue, 
we'll fix this for you immediately. And then I've had other people that have called and 
called and called and they can't even get someone answer the phone. It's like it didn't 
even exist. I don't really know. Yeah. So it's quite interesting. The spectrum is quite 
wide in that regard. 


And are those residents that are calling or are those other staff members that. 


Are trying to residence in this case? If somebody's having an issue with connectivity, the 
easiest thing for me to do is just say try calling out. Because on our end, if all the 
information is input correctly and it shows that it's online, because if it's showing 
offline, obviously this is an issue that I could probably deal with. Telus, who is the 
internet provider and the installer for the product. Yeah, I mean, Telus will help 
troubleshoot like a hardware issue or a network issue, but outside of that got you. It'd be 
nice to fit. It's just that one person had that great experience and like Iotas was able to 
fix it like that and then other ones just like nothing. 


Yeah. Well, I'm curious how often your residents are using Iotas ADT today. 


It seemed like because we're part of this lease up right. So it seemed like the way things 
were rolling out, it didn't seem like we were on the positive end of the spectrum for 
people that were able to successfully use the product. Now as things have much evened out, 
but even more shifting to the other side where the majority of people are having a 
perfectly fine experience with it and they're not having any issues. 


Got you. 


I think we just kind of like early on, just like weeded out those few that we're having a 
lot of difficulty for whatever reason, hardware issues or otherwise. And then now the 
majority seems to be quite good. And then I think the functionality of it works really well 
too, especially with the remote lock unlock just as a quick example, like, I had somebody, 
he moved in, he had to go leave town for work. His brother was coming. Easiest way for him 
to let his brother into the unit was literally for him to just remotely just press the 
button. We tested it together because it was the first time that I wasn't sure if it was 
going to work for him. So I was talking on the phone. I was like, well, just press this 
button. I'll tell you if it locks or unlocks, it works fine. So it worked out for him, 
getting his brother into the unit, which just survives in the country. 


Right. 


So it was good. 


Yeah. Well, I'm curious. It sounds like after working out some initial difficulties, the 
residents are starting to have an easier time. How often should the residents be using 
Iotas in order to really get the full benefit, in your opinion. 


Juan? Honestly, if you can log on and if the resident is able to log on and create their 
own door code for themselves, that's, like, outside of that circumstance that I just 
mentioned where so and so had to let his brother in and he was in a remote location outside 
of stuff like that. Really? Just the ability to be able to make sure that you can program 
that. Alfred lock. You can put a code in that door that now you can use or provide to 
somebody else that they can use. That's about it. 


Got you. So it's really kind of that being able to unlock lock with a code or remotely. 


Yeah, exactly. But the remote stuff is not as frequent. Right. Like, how often are you 
having to do that versus what you really want to be able to do is I don't know how to set a 
door code for myself. Well, log into this app and you can create the code and ignore the 
fact that it tells you that it didn't work and try it because it might have worked. That's 
a frequency issue that we've had with the app. It would tell people after they've input the 
code for themselves, it gives them, like, an error message saying that it didn't work, but 
it actually did work. So it's, like, a little bit confusing to some other residents. 


Are there other situations that have kind of come up with that where there's maybe some 
confusion or has that kind of been less frequently? 


That happens less frequently. Like I said, just like, early on, a lot of those issues. More 
recently, almost none of those issues. 


Got you. Okay. 


Yeah. I'm not hearing back from any of our last 40 some residents that we've moved in that 
they're having problems with problems with Iotas or problems with the app. Got you. How 
many people are using it would be a different question. That's harder to say. We have a 
wide variety, wide demographic of people living in the building, and I think some just 
don't care. 


Well, I'm curious what benefits I know you kind of talked about being able to let your 
brother come in even if you're not in town, being able to create your own code, that type 
of thing. I'm curious kind of what benefits to your residents that you'd like to be able to 
offer. If I, Otis ADT, was able to offer it. 


Are you talking, like let's say you wanted to tack on more than just like the thermostatter 
more than. 


Just the locks possibility? Possibly, sure. 


Yeah. If you're talking to what you want, like, it's really, like, connected apartments or 
whatnot, adding things like being able to control your light timers to control your lights 
or whatnot. Right. And then to be able to set timers and stuff for lighting. That would 
make a lot of sense. Anything geared towards that energy type saving stuff would be really 
good. I'm trying to think of what else you want to talk. Like integration. We have 
submeters in our building for utilities. We have a company called Metergy Power and Water 
are both submeters having some sort of integration to be able to keep tabs. If we're 
talking about Iotas, like a one stop. Right. If you want to open up one app and be able to 
see everything that's going on in your apartment, having it integrated with stuff like 
that, like a water meter, like an energy meter through another company, to be able to see 
your usage at any given time would be really great for people that set up. Like, cameras, 
obviously, would be really good. Like the door cam or whatever. Or if you have cameras, 
like, outside on your balcony or whatnot, like security type stuff would be really good. 

Yeah. I don't know. You want me to get really creative with it? 


Yeah, get crazy. Those are, I think, awesome. Kind of thinking about residents. I'm also 
kind of curious for you on your end, all the different things that you mentioned that you 
have to do in balance and keep track of. I'm curious what benefits you wish Iotas ADT was 
able to offer you as a property manager. 


Yeah. Given what we have now with Iota and it's in current state and current offerings. 


Yeah. I mean, with what you have now, and if you think about those things that you just 
talked about for the resident, would any of that kind of impact stuff that would be 
beneficial to you from a more higher level management perspective? 


Yeah, I mean, some of the stuff I mentioned, like keeping tabs on your utility bills 
doesn't really matter to me because we're not paying them right. And we see the overall 
usage because we get the bulk bills. So that doesn't really matter as much. Obviously, if 
there was camera integration, that would have nothing to do with management. We would not 
have access due to security issues right. And confidentiality and whatnot. And that's fine. 

Yeah. I mean, I can't see a lot outside of, like, if I otis could somehow tell me if things 
are becoming damaged or if someone is like, oh, let's just say someone was, like, smoking 
in a unit. Right. Majority of these new builds, obviously they're all non smoking 
buildings. That would be really interesting from a management perspective to be able to 
know if someone was lighting up in the unit, because I would have some sort of proof too, 
other than a complaint from a neighbor or whatnot. 


Got you. 


Yeah. Outside of that, no, not too much else, really. Just being able to keep the residents 
happy. Right. Giving them something extra to offer them is good. Right. But from my 
perspective, how that resident uses that tool doesn't really matter to me as much. It 
doesn't really affect me unless I can't think of too much, like, real data that's being 
pulled from it that's going to tell me, like, am I going to rent to this person again? 


Got you. Is there any information about your residence or building today that you find 
valuable that you receive from Iota ADT today? 


Thus far? No. 


Okay. 


Yeah. No. 


What information would you want to know, if any? I know we can talk a little bit about 
that. I'm curious. 


Yeah. From my side of things like the temperature alerts and obviously the water sensors. 
That's goal for property management company, if it's functioning appropriately, if it's 
working and it's accurate, if some jackasses left their window open and their suite 
actually reaches below ten degrees and it's the middle of winter and they're going to 
freeze a pipe, that would be yeah. You want to know because you want to get somebody up 
there. You want to be baggy on the door, and if they're not answering, you're going to go 
in and make sure there's a window closed or whatever. That is really important stuff, but 
just like, as it's functioning right now, it's not warranted. I can't go barging into 
someone's unit if this app is telling me that your unit is really cold. You know what I 
mean? It's not trustworthy enough at this point with the experiences we've had. 


Got you. 


Yeah. 


And what would you have to kind of see different in order to increase that trustworthiness? 


It's just it just needs to be accurate. Like, there needs to be, like, some, like, testing 
to those systems, and then it needs to come back with, like, a high degree of accuracy, 
like low variance of it making a mistake. Do you know what I mean? I need to be able to 
trust it. If it tells me that so and so sweet is 32 degrees in the middle of winter, be 
like, oh, my God, that sweet's on fire, you know what I mean? Like, or like, why? And then 
there's got to be, like, a real reason behind it, you know, it's going to lead me to 
investigate. 


Gotcha. 


Yeah. Because like if I call that person and, you know, I'm bugging them about this, I'm 
just wasting my time and they're telling me, no, everything is fine. Okay, yeah. 


Well, I'm also curious oh, go ahead. 


No, I was going to say the intent is there for these things, and I think that's amazing. 
But refining that technology a little bit and making it work to a better degree of 
accuracy, as I mentioned, is kind of imperative for it to be a useful tool to the 
management. 


Got you. And as you know, Iotas was recently purchased by ADT, which is known, obviously, 
for security. I'm curious kind of what role you see security playing with smart technology, 
if any, or what features would be beneficial to you and your property. 


So ADT would do like access control, right, I would imagine. And cameras. 


You're in charge of this part, so yeah, access control, cameras, what else? 


Yeah, if you're talking about security, those are the two biggest things, like access 
control and cameras. So you're talking about an ICT system, like a Fob system. Access for 
the doors and then between the floors and the elevator, and then cameras that are 
accessible and easy to use that store data remotely, so that if our system goes offline and 
the power shuts down, we would still have access to security footage in some way. That's an 
issue right now. It's all just like, hardwired in a computer. If the power shuts off and 
the computer shuts off, I don't have any cameras, everything is down, and there's a big 
gap. There's a big gap in the time. Right, yeah. Having it keep going, maybe on like a 
backup battery even, so the power goes down and things keep recording, and then storing 
that on a cloud, that would be really good, really important. Currently, our camera system 
that we have set up at Rundall is accessible, I think, only to us, the residents. There is 
one camera on the butterfly MX terminal, so if somebody actually calls them from the door, 
they can see that person. But I think it would be interesting to be able to provide the 
users or the residents just access to a single camera, maybe pointed just at the front 
door, so that if stuff is happening after hours, you would be able to just take a quick 
peek before you go down to let somebody in or whatnot. So and so call saying skip the dish 
delivery guy. Maybe you want to check and make sure it's skip the dish delivery guy. 


Right, yeah. And last question about this section before we move to the activities, 
thinking about those possibilities, as well as kind of other things that we've talked about 
from a property manager standpoint, is that a tool that you can access that all from your 
computer? Is that something where there's benefit to being able to have it mobile or I'm 
curious kind of what that looks like, what's the most beneficial. 


There's benefit to having anything mobile. Right now I am one building, so the fact that I 
am not logging into Iota's dashboard on my phone is not really a big deal. But let's say I 
take on that other project. Maybe now I'm traveling between the two buildings. Or maybe I'm 
over at the other building and I need to know what's going on over here. Maybe I'm at the 
head office. Having access to this stuff in a mobile capacity is always useful, for sure. 
Property managers are usually on the go. 


On the go? 


Typically, yeah. Typically not sitting around in my office. I've been doing more and more 
of that recently. 


Based on your to do list, I am not surprised that you're not sitting around very much. 
Well, what we're going to do now is we are going to do an activity. I'm going to share my 
screen. The goal is to kind of get a better understanding of what is most important to you. 
So I'm going to share a list of needs that you might have in your job and then I'm going to 
ask you to plot them on this pyramid. So at the top of the pyramid, we're actually going to 
have you put what you need the absolute most. It can be something from our list. And I'll 
zoom in. If there's something we haven't thought of yet, we can add that as well. But you 
can only have one absolute top need and then the rest are going to be prioritized where the 
most important to you will be fulfilled towards the top and the least important will be 
fulfilled towards the bottom. So the needs that I will have you sort let me zoom in a 
little bit. We have make the tasks I complete on a daily basis easier to do. Help us 
identify optimizations to save money and increase efficiency. Ensure residents feel safe 
and protected. Ensure myself and other property staff feel safe and protected. Help us make 
our buildings feel like a community. Make communicating with my team and with residents 
easier. Help us attract new residents. Help us retain existing residents. Are there any 
needs that you have that are missing from this list? 


Just let me think for 1 second. I know I talked about it earlier in the call, but let's 
just throw on like, good access to support in the event that these things are not working. 
Or you can word that however it sounds best, but you kind of get the idea. Yes, sure. 


All right. Awesome. So with these, talk to me about where you would put what would be what 
you need the most. You only get one. 


This is really hard. 


I know. I'm sorry. 


These are all super important things. 


I know. 


Oh, man. 


And feel free to. 


In terms of retention, which I find to be super important because we do a good job of 
leasing. We put really great people in. These suites. It's just a matter of keeping them, 
but they don't stay if they're not feeling safe and protected. I feel like it's almost like 
number one and not myself and the other and the property staff because I'm used to working 
downtown. 


Okay, so insure residents feel safe and protected, as your name. 


Yeah. Put it at the very top. 


All right. Then from there. 


Yeah. Make the tasks complete, or the tasks I complete on a daily basis easier, 100%. 
Anything that makes my life easier is good. I will put that on the same line from a 
building perspective. 

I have to wear my hat that I share with the developer and the owners. So helping to 
optimize, identify optimizations to save money and increase efficiency, put that on par 
with making my life easier. 


All right. 


Easier and cheaper. We'll go with the help attractive residents. 


Okay. And where do you want that? Do you want it under what I could live without, or is it 
slightly more important than that? 


No, it's more important than that. Put it on the third. We're just working our way down, 
right? Yeah. Put it there. And then retention would be on the same line. 


Okay. 


Because this is technology and the technology stuff, I mean, if it's not working, you need 
good support. Because it's not my system, it's not my program. Right. Yeah. It's important. 
And then the last three, I guess they're sitting at the bottom of my list because I work 
down. 


Yeah. How difficult was it? Were there anyone were like, oh, this is no brainer, versus, 
like, oh, I'm debating between these two. 


Yeah. I think the two that I picked second from the bottom are second from the top for me, 
like, making the tasks easier and helping to optimize and save money could almost be on par 
with helping to attract new residents and retain existing residents. But that's also 
because I think of this particular project that I'm in right now in terms of the lease up. 
To attract angular residence is very important. Right. But at the same time, it's not stuff 
that gets advertised ahead of time. Right. We're not in our marketing telling people that 
we have Iota and your suite is connected and whatnot. These are all just great features 
that we will are happy to tell you about once you're kind of in the door. You know what I 
mean? 


I'm curious if there's ever a time that you can imagine using that as kind of a way to 
bring residents in by saying, hey, we have adtiotis. I'm curious what would need to happen 
in order for it to be that. 


Kind of people would need to know what it is, essentially, because they don't necessarily 
know what that is right now. It needs to be explained to them. We refer to them as, like, 
the Telus Smart Apartments because I think the app that's actually connecting through Iotas 
our users are using through the Telesmart apartment app. 


Got you. 


Right. 


Okay. So this last activity that we're going to be doing looks fun, right? Because we have 
candy, vitamins, and painkillers, but it is going to make you have to make some hard 
decisions again. So these are a list of potential features that Iotas ADT could add into 
their product experience. So I'm going to have you sort but this time we have three 
different categories. There's candy, which brings temporary joy, but in the long run does 
not have meaningful benefits. We have vitamins, which will make things better, but they're 
not essential. And then we have painkillers, which solve for a painful problem. So as we 
go, as I read through these, you're going to tell me whether this feature is candy, where 
it's fun but no long term benefits, vitamins, where, yeah, it'd be nice to have, but it's 
not essential, or painkillers, where, yes, this solves a painful problem that we have. So 
we'll start here. This first one. Residents receive proactive notifications with 
recommendations based on their behavior. So on average, three lights remain on without any 
motion, from 830 to four. Create one for a day routine. Where would that fall under for 
you? 


What is the vitamin again? A vitamin. 


It makes things better, but it's not essential. 


Yeah, that one. It's a vitamin. 


All right. What about your team enjoys using the dashboard because the experience is easy 
to use and beautiful. 


That's a painkiller. 


How did it bump into painkiller's status? 


Because it's making things easier for us, essentially. Right. If somebody has a complaint, 
you can't complain about something if it's working well and if it's good, essentially. 


Now we have residents are able to monitor energy and water usage for their unit and receive 
notifications about their usage. 


Oh, did you live create the space of a conversation? 


No. I know, right? 


Really? Wow. Okay. 


Mind reader right here. 


Yeah, I guess that's a vitamin. 


Okay. 


As well. 


You're going to be so sick of sorting and prioritizing things. I apologize. 


Okay. 


All right. Residents can shop for and add new devices preapproved by your team. 


That's a vitamin as well. 


Okay. Residents have enhanced routine options like weather driven routines or ones based on 
who it's home. 


I think that's a candy. 


Okay. Residents can set up other home utilities through their Iota SAP, like their electric 
or Internet provider, things like that. 


Yeah. Vitamin again. 


Okay. Your team has access to industry wide and market wide data related to multifamily 
homes. 


Oh, that's a painkiller. 


Why is that? 


This is super important, especially for the developers. 


And is there any particular kind of data, like, particular stats that are helpful to know? 


Well, I mean, it depends on who you're working with and who the owner is, but there's all 
sorts of data. I'm just trying to think in terms of this stuff, like, what they would 
really care about, I guess just in terms of even just like, usage reports, like knowing how 
many people are integrating themselves with the system and getting good use out of it would 
be really good. Knowing who's going to take things, like, one step further. Let's just say, 
for example, you have this option to shop for added devices and whatnot. Having that kind 
of data, as far as what kind of stuff people are purchasing, would be really important too, 
because that's like taking into consideration, like, future purchases that you might be 
making on behalf of those owners when you're building the suite. Right. When you're setting 
things up. 


That makes sense. All right, we only have a few left, so I'm going to go real quick because 
I want to make sure we leave time for questions. 


Yeah, no worries. 


Property staff can communicate with residents and other team members via an app. 


I don't want this candy. I suppose communication, like, stuff is important. It's not always 
great. It's good to have an option for a platform for the residents, I suppose, to be able 
to communicate, but I need to streamline the communications that are coming to me from the 
residents, and if it's coming from a lot of different sources, it's not great. 


Got you. Okay. Residents enjoy using the app because the experience is easy to use and 
beautiful. 


That's a painkiller. 


Okay, let me get down to painkiller. All right. Your team has access to property specific 
data insights that help determine your property health. Pinkhiller and I'm curious kind of 
what data insights are they similar to the ones we just mentioned or different? 


Yeah, I think similar to the ones we just mentioned. I mean, in this case, that relates 
specifically to something we have, which would be like the water sensor, for example. 
Right. 


Got you. All right. Your team can receive event based alerts. So like a water leak or a 
break in? 


Yeah, if it's working well, it's super important. So painkiller. 


Okay. And are there any features that are not mentioned that you would like to add? 


No, I think we'll just leave it. 


Okay, awesome. Well, I'm going to pause right now and see if any of our observers have any 
questions. So we'll open that time. 

Hi, Jonathan. Thank you so, so much. This has been incredibly helpful. My question for you 
is if I, Otis, could only focus on one thing and one thing only, and they can prioritize 
again, my apologies. They could focus on one thing and one thing only moving forward, what 
would you hope that they would focus on improving for you and your team? 


Yeah, if we're just talking about improvements, everything that I mentioned surrounding 
more accurate reporting for the temperature stuff, the battery alerts work fine for like, 
the alpha door locks, but the temperature alerts are just so out of whack that you cannot 
trust them. And it kind of makes me worry about the future of the water sensors and whether 
or not we're going to get accurate readings out of that stuff, too. I don't want to be 
calling the emergency line because I just got a water sensor alert in unit 404, and then I 
send people there and everything's fine. So we'll see. 


Makes complete sense. Thank you so much. 


No worries. 


Any other questions? All right, I have two questions. One is a sorting question, and then 
we're done with sorting questions, I promise. If you had to put Iotas ADT into one of these 
three categories, a candy, where it brings temporary joy, but in the long run, not 
meaningful benefits of vitamin, it will make things better, but it is an essential or a 
painkiller where it solves for a painful problem. Where would you put Iotas ADT? In. 


I suppose, right now it's a vitamin. Yeah. 


Do you want to tell me why? Because I want to know why. 


Well, I don't know how much of a painkiller it is because it's kind of in between. It's 
close to a painkiller. Somewhere in between. Like a vitamin and a painkiller. Maybe it's 
like antihistamine. I have allergies. It's good. Right. 

For example, I don't have to worry about running around and cutting a bunch of keys. I can 
give one to this tenant, and I can say, yeah, you just created a door close for yourself. 
Blah, blah, blah. Cut as many keys as you need. I've given you one. You still have access. 
That's perfect. Just as an example, the other features have been great for selling. It's 
been good because we can tell them this is connected, your door lock, blah, blah, blah. 
Super cool. And they're like, oh, yeah, this is really neat because they're coming from a 
place where they probably didn't have these things. And that's great. But I mean, on the 
other hand, that's kind of a nice to have. 


For it to have the most value for you and your job. Would it be a candy, a vitamin, or a 
painkiller? 


A painkiller. 


And why is that? 


Just because it's solving the biggest problems. Right. It's touching on those pain points 
that make things that would normally be more difficult. Now it's making a lot easier. 


Got you. And I know you said, obviously the keys. It sounds like that's a major pain point 
that now is definitely, yeah, I. 


Make things super easy. I just had one key and then got your keys. Make a code. You're 
good. 


I'm curious if there are any other pain points that come to mind that either they do solve 
for or that you would love it if they could solve for in our last 20 seconds. 


Other pain points. No, I can't really think of too much. 


You're like, I have thoughts so much this hour. 


Yeah. 


Thank you again for taking the time, for meeting with us, cutting your grocery trip short. 


Oh, thank you. I really appreciate it. 


One day a month, I can get. 


This done for you and relatively on time. It was only a couple of minutes late. Thank you. 


Yeah, no, you are totally fine. Thank you. And I will make sure that you get that incentive 
sent over and you really don't have to share it with your coworker. Totally up to you. 


No, we're going off the line. 


Here you go. 


Is it just, like, email or something? 


Yeah, I'll email it to you. 


Awesome. Thanks. 


All right. Thank you so much. 


Yeah, you're welcome. Everyone have a good day. Thank you. 


Bye.
 
Nancy interview:
Well, my role. I'm the Vice President, Procurement of services. On a daily basis. I'll have 
at least three to four different type of vendors. Services, calls to learn about new 
business. Or our existing business that we do business partner with. We you know, we have 
an issue I handle, like right now I'm getting bids on some waste trash services that many 
of our properties. So I handle most of the national big accounts. I don't handle individual 
accounts for properties. For the multifamily side, I handle just larger scale on the 
National. Side of for all properties how it affect all properties. On the adt side, for 
example. You know that one was that that service is based on. You know where we are 
financially. A lot of times when we're doing a renovation, we'll go in and do something 
like this. Maybe after the renovation. Only because the funds are so prevalent. It's kind 
of the leftover funds that they have that for a renovation, because we spend about $10,000 
per unit on our renovation. And that does not include smart technology. So that comes 
first. Smart technology comes second. Unfortunately. And so in some cases we may not may 
not be a renovation, but we add value to the property by adding smart technology. But I 
work with. About 50 different vendors that I handle myself on a monthly daily, whatever 
needed bases are 


gotcha and how many, you know, how many properties are you kind of. Over when it comes to 
these larger vendors. You know how many properties are we talking about that you're kind of 
making decisions for 


110. We 


have 110 


properties. 


Gotcha that's a lot. 


Yeah, it is a lot. There's a lot behind all the scenes. People don't realize. 


Yeah, I'm sure I'm curious. Like, what you would say is the most reward. Rewarding part of 
your job. 


When it's done. Well, you know, that's what I'm saying. It's like I just had I just had a 
you know, I had sent out an email to get something started, and it was on February 28. And 
I do not have my answer yet, which is frustrating to me not to have that answer so we can 
move on to the next steps. I guess there's a lot of steps to every decision that's made to 
get to the end results. So sometimes it's timing. And I will say since cobid. There are 
it's it's. More time is involved versus where we used to be able to get things done a lot 
quicker. Part of it could be supply. Are there's not enough employees from on that other 
vendor side? Whatever may be the case. It's just I will say cobit has changed on getting 
things done, timely. But you know that's kind. I guess the timeliness of getting things 
completed and finalized because there are some hopes you have to jump through on this end, 
on making sure that everybody's on the same page. That because a lot of the things that I 
do are outside. The. Vps of operations. I mean, they're aware of it, but they don't know 
the stage of the level of where I am. In doing this to get this end results finalized at a 
property. That happens a lot, just like when we installed ADT at the properties. They had 
no idea. I started it with the owner or the CEO of the company. He owns a lot of the 
properties I started with him and then I implement it from my desk by communication with 
the residents and training and. Not resonance with the. Site staff. And we all went through 
all of that. You know, in the steps that way to get it finalized. 


Man. 


Yeah. I'm I'm curious. Kind of what the role of technology is in your buildings today. At 
the property. Well as far as technology we have. Our property management software plays a 
big role. We have you know, they it creates our daily operations at a property. It creates 
our financial statements at a property. We have the incoming income coming in. And that's 
where we develop our financial statements. And we are residents have a resident portal that 
they can go into. It's all encompassed in yardy. And then our websites are not encompassed 
with yardy. A couple of properties are, but we do use another service for our websites 
that's managed that way. And then we have other technology that they had to go on to a 
dashboard. Maybe. Dorking that would manage some of their access. For. The that does not 
have adt, but adt does not manage my commercial side of access to my fitness centers or my 
dates or things like that. But they have another software called dorking that gives them 
access that way they have. Some of their dashboards that they work office for their 
advertising, that they go in and deal with that any of their social media that they're 
dealing with on it. There's a lot of. 

Sites that the properties are on and we do we have merged over to yardy a lot so they can 
only stay in yardy to work mostly, and they don't have to go into other locations. To but 
we try to keep them in one platform. And with. Adt. They go out of yardy. But you guys are 
integrated with yardy, which is fabulous. We do not work with. Any type of software that's 
not integrated with yardy because we want we do not want to do anything manual for data 
entry or anything like that. So that is a big deal to us that everyone's integrated. 


Yeah. Kind of a recent decision in terms of we're prioritizing integration over anything 
else or how long has that been? It's been that way for a while. 


I mean, that's what any company, if you're not integrated with all the major players in the 
property management software, you will probably not get that business because that's too 
much work at the site. Levels. Because what's happening is that you have a lot this our 
industry has high turnover. So training people on a million different things. And if 
anything is done manually. The Gen. Zers have no idea what you're talking about. They don't 
know anything about how to dial a telephone or how to push a button, even for a telephone. 
So they just only know their cell phones, so 


gotcha 


they wouldn't know how to act. 


Well, I'm curious. You know how. You expect you know that role of technology. To evolve 
over time in your buildings. You know if it does at all. 


Well, I'm not sure if it how it will evolve. I will say that we don't plan on taking on any 
new. Platforms that require. US. To learn something new. And that probably will go through 
2023. Because that one thing that I feel like will evolve, and I'm not sure what that's 
going to take for our office team to have any involvement with it that will probably put. 

The charging stations on our site. We do not have that right now for cars. We have car 
charging stations. But that will be a search module that people will be looking for when 
they're looking for an apartment. As do they have charging stations. So that that and I'm 
not sure how that technology would affect us. Internally at the office. I don't think it 
will affect us at all. It's just the installation of the equipment is what it would affect 
us financially. But, you know. Everyone will always be integrated with our property 
management software, but I feel like we're not going to add on any more programs that would 
take us. To not to be able to do our basics in our job because a lot of times what we even 
do today. It takes us away from leasing apartments. And if we're not leasing apartments, 
we're not making money. 


Gotcha no that. 's a big deal not to take us away. It needs to be 


easygreasy. Less staff involved. And then programs can be implemented. 


Yeah. I'm curious right now. Like in terms of seeing how. Property performance is, how do 
you measure that today. 


And measure it on what level, though. 


The different levels. Yeah. 


Well, we have, you know, we measure it for their occupancy. We see how many people are 
living in the apartments and bottom line. And that's a big deal. We're always. One our 
occupancy need to be nibbed and 90 to 100 really. But if it's a hundred percent that's 
that's not usual. Always that way. But high 90s is we're looking to always have occupancy. 
But we're probably at 91 overall as a property management company. And the market. Is 
softened a little bit. Because of inflation within our country. People are not being able 
to afford the rents like they were. And there's a lot of layoffs going off on some major 
corporations. But benchmarking if they're if they're having the income coming in over last 
year that's we benchmark everything from the previous year. How well we're joined now. And 
we have a very good. We had a great market growth last year. And we're. Feeding that this 
year. So we're doing very well. Nashville is a very hot market. 

The city and everything around it is, you know. In a growth mode so that makes the multi 
family side in the growth mode too. If the city doesn't have a lot of activity going on, 
usually the multi family side is either. Just flats or below. So. But you know, we measure 
it all on growth where we are from last year to this year on all levels. 


And then I'm curious kind of, you know, with that kind of seeing that girls from the 
previous year. That type of thing. What actions do you take based on you know how your 
property your properties are performing. 


Well, it varies. There was another platform that we used. It's called Real star. It's 
integrated with the already but it's. 

A wrench. Income producing module. I don't know if you've seen that in the news lately that 
Yield Star is under a class action lawsuit by tenants out of California by the Resident. 
And it's named large management companies. But yelstar is. It will look at your daily rent 
and change your rental rate. So those are the kinds of things that we look for. That we use 
services like that that helps us grow our rent. And that's how. We have been able to 
capture some of our market. Because before we would kind of look, okay, we're full on this 
apartment. Let's we're on full on a one bedroom, one bath. At this property, we're going to 
raise our rent, you know, $50. Well, yieldstall will raise at $300. So where we were way 
more conservative. This yield star is a much more aggressive. Type of program. 


Gotcha and then I'm curious about, you know, if a property you know that's in terms of a 
property is doing well, has high occupancy. I'm curious if, you know, a property isn't 
performing well, kind of what actions you might take for that. 


Well depends on where they're not performing if it's an occupancy issue. If it's you know 
if it's there could be their short on staff. So we know staffing has affected that. We just 
evaluate. By our curb, a pill will drive through the property and see, what does it look 
like? You know, first impression that's you know, when somebody drives in or has there been 
crime at the property or crime in the area? Has that affected. The property because you 
know what happens. Crime. There's no address. You know, it just. It just happens anywhere. 
Even though it may be a high end property, it could still have. Had a murder on there. So 
it's got a you know, it hit the news or something like that. So we have to evaluate. All 
avenues. The you know, if we had maybe we had a really bad freeze here in Nashville. So we 
had a lot of floods. And it actually. We we had a lot of units that went down, and we had 
to move the residents out. So that created vacancy. So it was could have been a maintenance 
issue. It could have been anything like that. So we evaluate. You know, have you know, and 
then we react. We react. Well, this is our plan. Okay? We're going to reduce the rent or 
we're going to offer a concession for new moveins everything's up and running again. And so 
we've done that. And at times when we've taken over an older property, purchase an older 
property, we'll change the name of that community. And. Have a fresh start. And have 
everything break every new attitude new mode of how we do business. 


Yeah. Thank you for sharing all that. I'm curious. You know, do you feel like there are any 
blind spots that you have when it comes to how your properties are performing. 


I will I mean because of the staffing issues. I do think that that's been has heard us a 
lot whenever you have staff turnover. Because. You're always starting over again. It seems 
like, you know, retraining these people, I guess probably some of our weakest links. I 
think that we have. Is training our staff because, you know, you kind of assume that they 
know. Are we promoting within our company, promotes it heavily? And did we train that 
person? We promote it from being. A leasing consultant to a system. And did we train her 
right? Being an assistant manager? Did we do the right thing. I can think of. Probably five 
right at the top of my head. That this person never got assistant manager training. So she 
got training from the. Former assistant maybe. But was she trained? Weren't right? Don't 
know. I just know that that I think training is probably. A big deal on how and we do have 
a training Department, but it's fairly new person that's in that position. And he's not 
from freeman webb. He's from outside of framing Web. So he's learning freeman Web as well 
to get good training implemented. 


Got you thank you. That makes a lot of sense. I appreciate, you know, giving me the context 
of all the things that you're juggling and thinking about as you're managing, you know, 
thinking about all these properties. I want to talk a little bit more about. I know you 
said, you know. Adt doesn't necessarily control kind of like the access. To the community. 
Like the exercise. Yeah. But I am can you talk to me a little bit about what adt products 
you're buildings use today. 


For through adt what we're using with 


adt. 


Well, we went to for smart technology for the units for the apartments. And we chose. The 
yellow lock is what we use, and it has a key override. We decided to do that. For. I guess 
kind of old school thinking that we have a key just in case something breaks. Are that the 
resident? You know we lost service somehow to the lock. We can still get into the unit with 
a key. And then so we have the yale lock. We have. The publish we call it or the panel, and 
then they have the digital thermostat that they can manage from their right from their 
phone. And we did choose not to get the leak little adapter things you put underneath the 
kitchen sink and so forth. We did not do that. We didn't feel like we had a huge. Problem 
with that. So we didn't go with that expense. 


That makes a lot of sense. I'm curious. You know how. Those particular products being in 
your. Properties. How do you see those products helping your residents. 


Well, I think it helps. I mean, it may help the residents, but it helps them. Our 
maintenance team tremendously. In the office. That tremendously. That's really where I hear 
it from. Because one thing where a resident would say, you know, I need you to let they'll 
do a key release to let their housekeeper in or their dog Walker in or whatever. And they 
do a key release. And we used to give them a key. Well, now they can create their own pin 
for this person to have that to get into their apartment. We don't have to deal with that. 
That type of involvement with the residents personal situation, or a kid get locked, gets 
locked out. And I mean, mom can be locked. Unlock the door right from her phone. We don't 
to deal with the kid not having a key. And then we have, you know, on a weekly basis, we 
have our pest control company come and they may have ten or 15 apartments that they can get 
in. That we can just give them a code to go in and service those apartments for that day. 
So that's kind of the ease for that. For infer maintenance. They have their own passcode to 
get into for their service request and things like that that they can go in and not have to 
go into the office and take the time and put the keys back. And also like we used to give 
vendors a key, and we made them leave their driver's license there and sign out the keys. 
And if you don't return the keys, it's going to cost you $50 per key. Well, we charge $50 a 
lot. So if they'd never, ever return the key, then we got to go through and re keying that 
key, that lock in those kind of things. So that saved us a lot of time that way. The 
residents like that that they can control their thermostat from home like for example, some 
of our days they may have left from home. At you know. 07:00 in the morning, and it was 
kind of cool outside. And they still had their heat on, but then it got to 75 during the 
day. So they wanted their apartment to be cool when they got home so they could turn their 
air conditioner on right from their phone. So that that was something that they really 
like. And just having the modern aspect of having, you know, digital lock. We don't hear a 
lot from the residence they expect to have. A lock on their door. Yeah. 


Well, I'm curious. You know. When it came to, you know, implementing. That smart technology 
with adt in your buildings. Was adt, the first smart technology you had worked with. 


It's the only one that we have worked with. I had ADT at home personally, so I knew what my 
app could do for me. I don't have a lock on there, but I have where I can control my 
thermostat. I have cameras I can see on my cameras at home. So I knew what it could do. 
And. It was, you know, it was easy. So I went. I looked at several different. Platforms. A 
lot of them. I will say the dashboard. Is. Very intuitive. And it's pretty easy to maneuver 
around it. And anyone can get what it's doing. I mean, it's just it's pretty simple that 
way. And it's not. Just an app. I have an actual dashboard, some of the other services. 
Were just an app. They didn't have a website where you can go to a dashboard or do anything 
like that. So that made a difference for me. Plus the self guided tour. That that was 
included in that because all the other ones have a self guided tour that goes with it. But 
they charge an additional monthly fee for that. 


Got you and when you reference the dashboard. Was that the dashboard for residents? Or was 
that more like the dashboard. For the whole property. I can look at the bacon to see. 


I mean, I went into vacant and. It was 35 degrees outside and they still had air 
conditioning on. In a unit that was down to 66. And I, you know, so I went in and I could 
change that from my desk and see that. And then I sent out an email to the manager and 
said, Look, I changed all the. Your thermostats and your vacants because they were on air 
conditioning and it's 35 degrees outside. So a vendor apparently did that because they were 
in there working and probably were hot. But you know, so we you know, we can control it 
that way. And then it was 630 at night. I was still here at the office. And I went and 
looked at a couple of them and they their bacons were unlocked. And so I knew that manager 
pretty well. I texted her, and I asked her. I said, do you realize that you've got, like 
three vacants that are unlocked. And she immediately went on the dashboard and we lock 
them. So, you know, not everybody's gonna be looking at like that. I'm just that person to 
do that because I want to make sure everybody's doing their job. I go in and look at the 
alerts to see how they alerts we have if there's a problem. We've had alert on one unit 
because the residents dog chewed a wire. 


So, 


Yeah. So I needed to help her get through that. And what she needed to do to get that 
repaired. But that was there for a month. That way, we don't want that to happen for a 
month. We want to offer the service. We have the capability of doing that. So we just so it 
gives us another set of eyes. 


Yeah for sure. I'm curious, how often do you kind of check that dashboard. 


The initial one we put one on in a property. I was checking it every day. Now I probably go 
on every couple of weeks. I don't go on that often. 


The newness has kind of worn 


off well. The first one we did because I wanted to make sure that it was working for 
everyone and so forth. We did that. We did that when I believe in. 2019. And then we put in 
eight more last year. So and so we did eight back and back to back to back. So, you know, 
there's some there's some alerts out there that I think that we still need to address. So 
and I'm working on that with adt because some of them were batteries, and some of them are 
not, you know, just a few months old. Of insulation. So we need to know why the batteries 
going down. So there's some things that we're tweaking and understanding that through adt 
and us 


gotcha. So it sounds like, you know. Alerts about batteries or different things happening. 
I know you also mentioned being able to see if. Vacant units, or unlock that type of thing? 
What other information about your residents or about your properties? Do you find valuable 
that you receive from adt today. 


Well I will say the other thing about the dashboard for the Occupy because we don't really 
try to be big brother to our residents. At all. But when we had, you know, a cold snap, it 
was 60 degrees during the day. And then all of a sudden, it dropped to minus one. And we 
had a lot of freeze going on. We lost a lot of plant material here in Nashville. So we went 
to our occupied to make sure that and it was during the, you know, holiday travel and 
things like that. So we went to our residents to dashboard to make sure that they had the 
thermostats on to at least 55 degrees. And. There were some that literally turn their 
thermostat off. So we turn them on. Then we went back and saw that he turned it back off. 
So we had to call the resident and let him know you're going to be responsible for damage 
if. When not 


if 


when these Pikes break so and you'll have a flood when you come back to it as well as 
paying for your neighbor's stuff that you flooded. So he understood and left it along then. 
But. It did. It did help us be Proactive. And not because we had a lot. I mean, a lot of 
damage on frozen pipes here in Nashville. A lot. 


Yeah, Nashville has been hit hard if you. 're you know information about your residents or 
buildings. Or properties that you would find valuable if adt could find a way to provide 
it. 


Well. If we could figure out. A very easy solution for the commercial side of it because 
it's a different division for them to do to take care of my amenities. To have that I would 
like that to be a whole package. And it seems like it's. A not an easy flow because I've 
tried to get them to do my common areas for that. And it's just not been an easy flow. And 
we want that to be included in the dashboard for a whole dashboard. We don't want that to 
be a separate dashboard. We want that to be on the same dashboard so that's something agt 
adp really needs to improve on in that area in the multibamily world, because everybody, we 
don't want to have to have another. Service that does that easily. And. Use that dashboard. 
And then have to go over to adt. It'd be like doing the commercial side of adt. So we 
really would like to have that. Be a solution for us. With when we do the apartments as 
well. That's a big deal to us. 


Gotcha. So it sounds like you're you're interested in having adt handle the common access 
as well, but you really need it to be, you know, one holistic experience, not kind of 
separate. 


Right. And the same thing we would like it to be if we have an alarm on site. That they 
would take that over as well. We'd like to have that to be the whole solution. So that 
would be the whole thing as well, that we have them take care of the alarm. That it's. I 
guess I would say easier to get it from adt because it seems it's a little clunky to gather 
the data from them because they don't really. Flow with the properties they're working on, 
because I don't think this has always been their portay. I know alarms had been there for 
tape forever, and I think that it's clunky for them to go outside of what they know now for 
the Smart technology. It's clunking for them to move over to the amenities or the. Date 
access. That should be something that they really try to marry together. And then. 
Properties all have alarms. They've been doing alarms for a while. That needs to be married 
as a package. Yes, we can do that. Yes, we can do that. Yes, we can do that. Versus well, 
let me get this commercial division over here to come over here and do that. Let them check 
this out. So it's like three different people. Three different companies of ads that are 
coming out to give us pricing. And I mean, I could have had probably. Five of my ten 
properties we put on smart technology. I could have had them have. The amenities included 
in that. It's just never worked out 


Yeah. So I'm curious, kind of, you know, thinking about, like, hey, I could hand this part 
over to erica's. Part to you. What other security features. Would you find beneficial you 
know, to you and your properties. 


What I would find? Well. It may be beneficial for the residents to be able to if they 
decide they want an alarm, you know, that would be something that would go. That ADT would 
work with the resident on that. We don't want to be involved on that if that's a resident 
choice. Yeah. Or maybe if there was a camera that we can add to that resident. We've not 
added cameras, but like, I have cameras at home. And I really like that because I, you 
know, whenever. They were having writing all over the nation. I mean, I could look at my 
cameras outside to see if there was anything happening outside. So that gave me peace of 
mind. So I know that that would probably a resident would like, you know, with the ring 
doorbell. People, you know, appreciate the things at their door. So that would be something 
that I think that if adt could add that solution of. Their type of ring doorbell. As a 
solution for the resident as well. I don't know what that takes to to wire that up and how 
that would affect. 


Gotcha I'm curious. You know, I'm definitely hearing, you know, some of the benefits of 
that smart technology and security. I'm curious if. You. See any risks with combining the 
security piece with a smart technology. 


The only thing that we would have. Not necessarily a risk is that the resident had an 
alarm, and we need to shut the alarm off. How we would get that code that they would put in 
a service request that we know to turn their alarm off. That would be the only thing how 
that communication would that we wouldn't walk into an apartment and not turn the alarm 
off. Set up. I don't know if we're prompted if we put in when they put in the service 
request. That resident has an alarm if it's prompted with, you know, big letters or 
whatever. And then they have a code access for that alarm. 


Gotcha okay. So handling alarms, it sounds like there might be a little more complicated 
than 


just right. We have we have residents that have alarmed through different companies now, 
and they give us the alarm password. We can't tell them they can't have an alarm. The only 
way we can tell them that they can't have an alarm if they have to. If. They're putting 
something in drywall and affecting our building, but. But we have we have codes for some of 
our residents now, but it is problematic because we turn those alarms. We've shut, you 
know, turn those alarms on where we were sounding the alarm button by not realizing that 
there really truly is an alarm in there 


gotcha. No, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for that. I'm going to shift gears now a 
little bit. I appreciate, you know, answering all these questions about, you know, your 
experience. And you know how you can see things moving forward, that type of thing. What 
we're gonna do now is I'm gonna have us do an activity, and the goal is to have a better 
understanding of what's the most important to you. And so I'm going to share a list of 
needs that you might have in your job. And I'm gonna have you kind of plot them on a 
pyramid. Let me show what I'm talking about. 

So and I'll Zoom in so we can read the needs a little bit closer, but just overall, you see 
here at the top, we have one spot for what you need most. So out of all of these needs, 
what is the absolute top need for you and your role and then. Working our way down we have 
the least important where we have what I could live without. And so what I'm gonna do is 
we're gonna read through these, and I want you to kind of talk out loud as you kind of tell 
me what goes with where. I might ask, you know, some follow up questions, but really kind 
of wanting to know your thought process about how to prioritize. These needs. 

So we have. I'll read through all of them. First. Make my team's day to day job easier. 
Help us attract new residents. Make it easier for my team to communicate with each other 
and with residents. Help us identify optimizations to save money and increase efficiency. 
Help us make our buildings feel like a community. Ensure residents feel safe and protected. 
Help us retain existing residents and ensure property staff feel safe and protected. 


Yeah, that's all. Everything 


okay? I was gonna say we have room for an extra one if you can think of anything else. 


You kind of hit with a feel like a community because we do have residents or, you know, I 
guess. 

I guess Resident services. 

I think Resident Amenities and services. 

It is a strange 


word and I'm always like, Where's the n I know there's some ends in there. What we'll do 
now is. Thinking about this. What you need absolutely. Most. Talk to me about which one. 
Lands at the top of the pyramid for you. 


Well, first and foremost, I mean, we have to attract new residents to our community. I 
mean, that's kind of how we make money. 


Okay, so that's the top one. And was that a pretty like a nobrainer to pick that one. 


Well, it may not be made out of what we have up there. It really is. I mean, that's what we 
do 


to 


attract. I mean, we spend a lot of money on our advertising efforts and our social media 
platforms, on Google. We spend a lot of money there to attract residents. To our. Property. 
So. But, you know, there's things that go hand in hand with that. Now that we got the 
resident. Now we need to ensure. Some of these resident, you know, communication here that 
you ensure residents will say, protect it. Help our existing help us retain our existing 
residents. I mean, probably. That would be. The next to ensure help us ensure our 
residents. Both of that one and an ensure residents feel safe and protect it. 

And then. Make my team's day to day job easier. 

And share property. Staff feel safe and protected. 

Make it easier. For my team to communicate with each other and with residents. 


Okay. 


And then those three equal. The next level. 


Okay. So we have resident services and amenities to help our buildings feel like a 
community. And help us identify optimizations to save money and increase. Efficiency. 


Let me see. I may be changing that to the next level. 


And 


terrorism. Let me see. I mean, it's kind of equal. We probably add that. Third level, I 
would add something else up there. Help us identify optimization to save money, increase 
efficiencies. We need to move that one up to the second one, 


and then we're going to help us retain residents. We're going to move that down to the 
third one. Okay. But I'm going to tell you which one you're going to take out of that one. 
Hang on. It sounds good. Yep. You decide. 


I guess we're going to go take that make change day to day job easier down at the bottom 
and then help us. 


I grab the wrong. Here we go. All right. And so this goes here. So talk to me about kind of 
that decision with that shuffle. 


Well because. We have to make money in order to make any kind of efficiency. I mean that's 
that would probably be the owner's number one up there. But my background I've been in 
operations. And I've been in marketing and training. So my background is we have to attract 
residents in order to optimize any of our money. 


So. But but we do have to opt as an 


optimized to save money. And increase efficiency, which will go hand in hand to making our 
teams day job easier. So that would be. Our efficiency would be that way and then, but we 
also need to make sure that residents still safe and protect it. In a whole big scheme of 
things. Once we get them, we've got to take care of them once they're there. Okay. And so 
by taking care of them to the next level, it we will be retaining them because we've taken 
care of them that way. And then we you know, with the. Efficiencies, and so forth. We feel 
like that is going to be covered under the for the property staff to feel safe and protect 
it. But by good communications with the residents in the staff, we will all know what's 
going on exactly if somebody didn't feel faith. So that's where that goes. Hand in hand. 
But Resident services and amenities. While those things are really, really important. That 
doesn't mean. They're the roof over their head is the most important amenities with these 
secondary to their actual apartment structure that they're paying their rent for. A lot of 
residents think they're paying for amenities, but. They're paying their renter. The 
welling. Yeah. And then. And make it feel like a community that goes hand in hand with the 
services that we offer. But it would also make them feel through our communication that we 
feel like a community that way. So a lot of these things all play together, you know, they 
play in the sandbox nicely together. 


Yeah. So it sounds like for you these top three. Really. Our foundational for the rest of 
the things to happen. 


Right. 


Got it. Okay. Awesome. I'm gonna do one other prioritization. And this is going to be more 
thinking about. Potential features adt might be able to add into the property or the 
product experience. So we'll read through these. But first, I'll show you how we're going 
to categorize them. So we have three different categories. We have candy where this feature 
might bring temporary joy, but in the long run, doesn't have meaningful benefits. Is really 
where it goes. 

Then we have vitamins. So is this a feature that might make things better, but it's not 
essential. And then we have painkillers. Is this a feature that solves for. A very painful 
problem that one might have. And I can repeat those as needed as we go through this. But 
what we'll do now is I'll read through these potential features. You tell me kind of where 
you feel like they fit. And we do have an empty one. If you think of an additional feature 
that you would love that maybe we didn't include here. So our first one, we have residents 
can shop for and add new devices preapproved by your team. 


That's what. Is vitamin? What's the vitamins? Where it's helpful, but it's not essential. 

That one would probably fall in there. 


We have residents have enhanced routine options like weatherdriven routines or ones based 
on who is home. So. There's, you know an impending ice storm coming to Nashville. We're 
gonna turn on everybody's seat that type of thing. 


Always moving. I'm gonna say that's candy. 


We have residents are able to monitor energy and water usage for their unit and receive 
notifications about usage. 


I think that that's probably a problem solved down there at the bottom. 


How do you see that? Now? How is that problem popping up for you. 


Well. They're not necessarily notified about any kind of water issue, but if they could be 
notified. I mean, we we notify our residents through Rent Cafe, which is part of our yardy 
that we can do a mass email, mass notification. Some of them get it by text. Some of them 
can buy email. So if there's something going on at the property, you know, we can mass send 
that information out. So that's really important for us to have to give them. Notification 
that way. But if a resident has something going on, like if they had an alarm that they're 
alarm is going on, that they're notified that way. So that would be that would be that 
would stop some issues. 


Okay. All right. We have residents can set up other home utilities through their ADT app. 
So their electric or their Internet providers something like that. 


That would maybe for the resident, that would be essential. But. 

I mean, that's probably easier for some of the geneseers. I don't know. I don't even know 
if our electric company allow them to do that here. They're kind of old 


school. 


And that is, you know, it's a one time deal that they do that. So it's temporary in my mind 
that it's not. So I'm gonna put that a candy. 


You're allowed to change your mind. I promise. Okay. So then we have residents received 
Proactive notifications with recommendations based on their behavior. For example. On 
average, three lights remain on without any motion from 08:30 A.m. To 04:00 p.m.. Why don't 
you create an out for the day routine. 


As I said, temporary. 


We have property staff can communicate with residents and other team members via an app. 


I think that that is a vitamin. Property, cap and community. There isn't an other team 
members via App. We do that now. With teams. And we're to communicate with. Teams to 
individual. 

That one could be down at the bottom. I think that would be, you know, good communication, 
really important. 


Okay. Sounds good. Your team can receive eventbased alerts, like a water leak or a break 
in. 


That would be a painkiller. 


We have your team has access to property specific data insights that help determine your 
property. A health. 


You know, I've heard these. That these words before Property Health. I've heard these words 
before. On different platforms? People trying to sell me different things like that. I 
mean. At this point where we are, it's only going to be a vitamin. 


Okay. And talk to me about why that is. 


Because the things that go handed, the financial investment that goes hand in hand with 
that, it's more than what we want to spend. I mean, it's probably great. But then there's a 
lot of money that's involved with that property, health. So that's why I know. From the 
operation thinking it's going to be more than what we want to spend. 


Got you and are you accessing this type of information about your properties in a different 
way currently or is this just kind of a known. Like, I know you're gonna show me and I know 
you know what we'll have to happen. 


Well, yeah. I mean. You know. Where in the business to make money just like anybody else 
is. But I just know it's a it's. You know what to have. Property Health you have to have a 
lot of. Technology, you have to have a lot of people looking at this technology and looking 
at reports that this technology provides that's a pretty big. Involvement. For people. It's 
not something that simple. And we really want ease of things. We do not want anything 
that's going to because not only are we doing. Technology like services like this. We're 
still running the show. We have, you know, 50 other applications that we're working on, 50 
other platforms, 50 other different things that we do. Data. Where I'm just going to say 
ADT. They just do ADT. But we do the other 49 things, not ADT that we do collect rent. We 
send people to the attorney. Agency. We you know, the dog is loose. We help, you know, get 
the dog. We, you know, right in our work order. I mean, we do a lot of things at a property 
that people don't realize the day to day. And I recommend any vendor to go, say, a weekend 
of property and see what happens. So because it's very busy on a property. 


Oh. That's not what we do. I, you know, we've been talking to property managers as well, 
and I have learned so much more about what goes into that it is very different than what I 
initially. It's really kind of sad because the fun is taken out of that 


because it used to be a but be about meeting people you got to meet. You got to have a job 
that you're flexible. As far as meeting people, you start an office setting, but you still 
got to get up from your desk and go outside. It's not like that. It's not like that now. 
Yeah. Seems like everybody strapped to their desk trying to do a report. 


Gotcha so there's been some pros and cons. With all of this new technology coming in. 
Absolutely. 


Your team says access to industrywide marketwide data related to monthly family homes. You 
talk maybe survey information. 


I mean. Tell me if that would be helpful, or if you would think of something else. This is 
definitely kind of more. 


Marketwide. Data related. I mean because that's so broad. You know, you know, depending on 
what kind of data, because it depends on who's going to use it. But I do think that because 
we do monthly market surveys and having access to as much information. Is is a painkiller 
for them to have more information available to them. So I'm going to put that in the 
painkiller side. 


And is there particular. Data. Or you know, steps or insights. That you know your team 
finds particularly, you know, helpful when you're looking at all of the information you 
have access to. 


Well, the things that we, you know, we look at, you know, we compare their amenities to our 
amenities. You know, we and then sometimes we know that they're going to be doing a giant. 
Renovation. We know that. So that means they're going to step up their games. So their pipe 
gonna raise their rants in order to do that. So we need to capitalize on our current rents. 
You know, you know, our rents are going to be $200 cheaper than theirs because they are 
doing a renovation. So that's going to cost money. But then when all that product gets 
done. Compared to speaking. They're going to look super nice, and somebody may be willing 
to spend $200 more to get, like, a brand new apartment. So. Those things. So we compare our 
amenities, location. We compare the rents. That's, comparatively speaking, what we do. So 
you know, that information. We have to we have to gather that every. New cost per square 
footage. We determine that kind of thing. So we may have smaller apartments and but our Red 
sequelly the same. So you know, we have to we have to build off of that by offering maybe 
better amenities. 


Got it so many things that you're like having to juggle and keep track of. 


Residential because the experience is easy to use. And beautiful. Well, we're going to use 
a program that has an app. We certainly would want it to be easy to use and beautiful. So 
that would be a painkiller. 


Let me move that over there. And then the last one we have on here is. Kind of the same 
thing, but it's for your team. So your team enjoys using the dashboard because the 
experience is easy to use and beautiful. 


That would be painkiller. 


Are there any features that you can think of that we haven't necessarily talked about that 
you feel like. Would be. Beneficial in any of these categories for you. 


I'm trying to think of different services that might be out there. That would be, you know, 
to make their job easier. But hands off for them. That's the big deal. Like I was just 
telling you about the charging stations. You know something like that. If it was a service 
or an amenity that was. Ease for the resident to use, but hands off for the staff. And that 
would be a problem solver that they that the resident that they employed didn't have to be 
involved with that. We still offered this that the employees were hands off on that 


gotcha. So adding kind of. Benefit to the residents without requiring anything additional. 


For the site 


team. Yes. 


Would be a painkiller. 


Okay. That'd be a painkiller. Are there any particular like, I know you mentioned kind of 
the chargers, the car chargers. Are there other kind of either services that you can think 
of or kind of issues that you hear from. 


Well, I'll tell you a painkiller. Well, it's really a candy. No, it's a painkiller that 
doesn't have a resolution. As our packages. A package service. So for you know all these 
package lockers are out there. They're Super, super expensive. And you have to have panels. 
Of lockers you know which you know it can cost you a hundred thousand dollars depend on 
your size of property, because that's what they base it on. 


And how many properties, how many units you have there, and how many panels blockers you 
need to have. 


To suit. They've done some kind of mathematical air, in my opinion, to come up with that 
solution. But because it's so expensive. But then you've got to train the delivery people 
to put those packages into. The to the locker. They don't they just throw down on the 
ground in front of the lockers. So it's a waste of money that we do. So there needs to be a 
better package solution. Because you know, it's turned into an employee, you know, getting, 
taking. The package and the resident come in and getting thinking they have a package or 
they don't we check to see if I have a package. Well, they're interrupted with, you know, 
they're helping a customer already, and then they try to interrupt them because they're 
there and want to get their package. In 2016, we stopped taking packages all together at 
the site levels, you know, the great service and it was free to us. But it became an over. 
It was a nightmare. In 2016, everybody was ordering. It seemed like from wayfare they had 
furniture being delivered and they weren't at home to accept this. And they thought that 
the property was going to accept. That we don't accept that. And we don't let people into 
their apartment. We don't go down to their apartment and open the door for these delivery 
people. That's not our 


jobs. 


They. Didn't you know? So that became packages acceptance. We need a better solution for 
package acceptance. 


Yeah. And well, and I'm sure that's just increased even more since 2016. 


Oh, it is 2020. Everybody was getting everything at home. And and Amazon was everywhere. 
And Amazon. They're the ones that really need to come up with the solution. I mean, they're 
doing package lockers, too, but again, unless you get, you know, Ups and and everyone else 
to put them inside the lockers. That's not going to happen. They're forced to do it. 


I have one last. Candy, vitamin, painkiller question for you and then we're going to be 
wrapping up if you had to put. Adt into one of those. One of these buckets. Is ADT a candy, 
a vitamin or a painkiller for your properties right now. 


Well, the ones that we're using it on it's a painkiller. I mean, it's it's helping us solve 
many problems and gave us an advanced having an amenity. That being an older community, 
most of our communities are a little older. So it's been a painkiller for us. I mean, I 
wouldn't keep doing it if it wasn't because we're getting ready to add on two more 
properties. 


Got you. 


So if we felt like that was something. I mean painkiller. To me. Sounds like it's a pain, 
but they're not. So it does help solve a lot of solutions. And I do that I think I hear 
more positive feedback from the maintenance because that they have access to do different 
things. That took them that they had to stop what they were doing and go get a key and do 
all those things. But we don't have to do that now. 


Got you 


but yeah so. It's good. We like it. And I like and I and again I went through. And even 
this year, when we were looking at doing two more, I did call some of the competitors to 
see where they were. They've improved on their dashboard. If they you know where their 
pricing was and price does matter. And and I did share with. Adt group that I was on a call 
with them when they were doing something in Orlando or wherever they were. Is that. Their 
monthly cost per unit. Exceeds my cost of my property management software. So those are 
things that they need to keep in mind when we start charging things per unit. And I'm glad 
this is being recorded because this is really important for people to hear that. They 
exceed my cost of my property management. Software that manages the income, manages the 
residents. Manages. That my financial Statements manages our resident interaction with the 
software. So it costs more than that. So those are the things that going forward. They have 
to think about because we may have to consider maybe a less of a program if their prices 
get too high. Because we may have to consider something that's more affordable. Per unit to 
manage the dashboards and so forth like that. 


Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense. Nancy, thank you again for taking time to meet with me 
and answer all the questions. We really, really appreciate hearing your perspective. So 
thank you again. 


Okay. Thank you. Observer. You got any questions. 


Any questions? No. 


No. This has been great. Thank you so much. 


You're welcome. I thought I'd just put it out there. Bye bye. 


Go for it.
 
David interview:

For you? Yeah. There's definitely not a typical. Work week. I mean, if I if I had to put it 
in the best terms possible, you know, every day coming into the office. We open up 
everything here in the office from, you know, Lights, coffee maker, TVs. Are wax candles. 
And you know, just make the office presentable touch up clean. You know, any spot check and 
things like that. We then open up our model apartment doing the same process. Turn the 
lights on. The wax candles and just, you know, see if there's anything that out of the 
ordinary that we need to clean up. I'll then check my emails, check our voicemails, and 
respond to everything that needs to be responded to. Answering calls throughout the day, 
every day of the week. For either resident issues or prospects looking to rent. And then. 
At the same time my maintenance guys. I usually touch base with them every morning and see, 
you know what's on their plate for today, if there's anything that. Definitely needs to be 
addressed today. And then prepare for the following day. There's random reports that I'll 
give you know or task that I need to do for upper management. You know, like my CEO, or, 
you know, Regional Manager. So we get that. Knocked out during the day as well. And then I 
have my weekly test that I put on my calendar that I do every week. And those can be. 
Simple Things from pooling reports. To, you know, submitting Overtime Payroll for my 
maintenance guide. To. Just walk in the property having. A every Wednesday, walk the 
property for any issues on the exteriors of buildings that maybe my guys don't notice that 
I need to have address. And then every Friday. I do my bills, so we submit our bills to our 
Accounting Department. And we do a Friday report summarizing what we did that week and send 
that over to my regional and my CEO. 


Gotcha thank you. It sounds like there's definitely. Well, it may differ daytoday. You kind 
of have some routines, you know, setup. That's right. Yeah. What kind of things? Disrupt 
that standard routine. 


Oh, so that would be the unannounced. You know Resident issues. For the most part. 
Everything else. You know, we every day, you know, we have prospects looking to rent 
apartment. So my leasing girl usually will take care of that unless there's. A question or 
a concern that they have where they would need to bring me in and ask me about it. But 
other than that, it would just be. You know, some sort of resident complaints about another 
resident or an issue that we weren't made aware of, where I would have to step in and see 
what's going on and have it addressed. 

I would say that's probably once a day I have something along those lines that, you know, I 
would need to stop what I'm doing to address that right away. 


Gotcha. How do you typically communicate with residents. Usually so not like coming in with 
a big complaint. But just how do you typically communicate with residents. 


Well, if it's something for the office side where we want to communicate to them that, you 
know, there's either a vent going on, or maybe we have to shut the water off or an 
emergency repair and things like that. We have an app, a community app called Lively, and 
we. Will send out a Max message. So everyone that is a resident has that app and they'll 
get a notification just stating whatever it's for. So like, we'll do things about food 
trucks. You know, we have a food truck that's gonna be coming next week. So we'll give them 
information on that. Or like I mentioned, if there's an emergency plumbing repair. We have 
to do and we have to shut off water to a couple of buildings. We'll send out a message to 
those residents and let them know that way. Other than that, residents will usually either 
call the office, email me or personally come in into the office. If they're on their way 
home, they drive right by the leasing office. They'll just stop in and say, Hey. 

I want to let you know about this or I have somebody visiting. What do I need to do? Yada. 
Yada. So yeah. 


Gotcha thank you. What other kind of tools do you use at work? I know you just mentioned. 
And I can't remember the one that you mentioned. The one that you live. 

Specific tools do you use to help with your particular role at work. 


We got a lot. We're very tech friendly. So I mean, a lot of our stuff that we do tool wise 
is, you know, through the computer. So we have a tow company, and that's where I would log 
into a portal and input our residents vehicles information if they have a rental. To put it 
in the system so it doesn't get towed. But we register every residence, vehicle in there. 
We have. A. Security alarm company, where we have key fobs for residents that we have to 
input every time they either lose their card or need a new card. So we have a website for 
that. We have. A. Leak detection company that we use called cairo's and they have a portal 
as well. So if there's ever any type of leaks, we have equipment attached to the water 
heaters at hvac Systems and we'll get notifications so that we can address which units that 
belong to so we can get in there preventative. Preventatively before it becomes a big 
issue. Let's see, we have. Another system that. Inspection. System. So like if we have a 
move out or move in, we have an app on our phone that we can take pictures and do. Our unit 
inspection. So we have a record keeping of that. 

What else. We have. Company we use for pet screening. So like all of our residents that 
have pets, they input their pet information. Into. This system as well. And so we can keep 
track of whose pets are. Out of date for their Vaccination records. Or you know, they want 
to add a new pad so they upload all their info on the ped and the picture and you know, 
verify all the information is correct if it's a service animal or the most support animal. 
And then we have a property management software called One Site and Real Page that, you 
know, we put in all our service tickets. And that's where all the bulk information is for 
our residents. Contact information. Their ledgers. You know. Just pretty much all the other 
details as far as billing and accounting goes. 


Gotcha yeah, you are definitely tech friendly, I would say with all the mini ones. I'm 
curious. Do any of those kind of overlap with each other with how they support you. 


I don't think that they really like they're all unique to themselves. Where. You kind of 
got to go into each system. You know where you know the link detection and equipment on one 
thing and then. Your alarm systems, a different website with a different company. So I 
don't think any of them really overlap with each other. Besides lively. And a Property 
Management software. Those two are kind of integrated into each other. So whatever. 
Resident uses the Lively app to put in a service ticket. It'll synchronize with our pms 
system, and then, you know, we don't have to do that. That extra work by putting in that 
service ticket. So that that's convenient. But other than that. I don't think anything else 
is layered on top of each other, integrated with each other. 


Yeah, and with all those different tools. Are those ones that you kind of. Have like a 
rhythm, a routine for checking or any of them kind of just as needed type of. Programs. 


I mean, there I have a routine. I have my own routine. I'm just a little bit more. Anal 
about things. So like I'll go in every once in a while and just check them and make sure 
that things are accurate up to date and they're working properly. So that's just me 
personally. I mean, I don't put a reminder in there. I know if I'm caught up with my work, 
I'll like, you know, take the time and say, let me check on this. Let me make sure that. 
Everything listed correctly. There's no issues on that end. 

I wouldn't say that. There's like a routine where I check it on the daily basis or anything 
like that. 


Gotcha thank you. Well, and thinking about all of those tools that you use on a scale of 
one to five, where one is much worse. And five is much improved. How improved is your 
daytoday work life based on the technology that you have supporting you. 


I would probably say. I would say it's a five, you know, because before a lot of these 
programs and systems that we use, it was more old school. So I think it's definitely helped 
out where it's. A lot easier to multitask. And just kind of have, you know, multiple tabs, 
open and all these systems up at the same time. It's quick and easy. I think there's always 
room for improvement where we can be, you know, even less handson. But I think that just 
goes with residents and their ability to use the software or, you know, these tools. You 
know, from your elderly, you know, residents where they're not really too tech savvy or 
experience with it to the, you know, the younger ones that are all about it. But they just 
maybe they're not responsible enough yet. And they just they don't know. And they just, you 
know, would rather call. So. I don't think we'll ever be at that point where it's just more 
hands off where it's fully on their shoulders. But I think we're very close. And I think 
we're at the right point with that with our software that we, you know, have the ability 
for them to use it. But then, you know, if they don't feel comfortable, they can always 
contact. US so I think it's the right median for. That. 


Yeah. That nice little balance. Talk to me a little bit more about. Kind of the impact of. 
Residents, you know, using Tool, the Resident Side tool. How that impacts, you know, the 
work that you are doing and your staff is doing. 


I think that. I think it impacts it in a good way because. Again if. There are. Issues and 
the resident just puts it in it's automatically going into the system. And our maintenance 
staff are made aware of it so they're able to kind of see as it comes in and gauges their 
workload. Especially if it's after hours. So we come in the next morning and it's all there 
rather than. US coming into the office and then getting the multiple phone calls or emails 
and people then telling us so they kind of have a better idea to plan their day first thing 
in the morning instead of and then obviously within emergency they're able to kind of. 

Plan for that in their work schedule. Like added onto it or revise what they're going to do 
because an emergency takes precedent, of course. But I think it definitely benefits more. 
Workload more than anything. Just kind of helps us plan things a little bit more. 


Yeah for sure. Curious how technology makes your job harder if it does, it all. 


I can't really say I can't really say that it makes it harder there's nothing that I could 
think of off the top of my head I would say it makes it harder. Except if there's. Tech 
issues like it issues or support issues where the text not working properly and then you 
know, coming to us and us saying. Either I gotta try and figure it out or send them to the 
right person to try to figure out. I think that. Separation between what we can do and what 
the it or the support team can do. That's the biggest thing. 


Gotcha. And do resonant seem to kind of know. Who to go to for that, you know. When it 
comes to technology, and it is it your office, is it maintenance? Is it you know, the third 
party technology who kind of handles. Those issues. 


It all depends on who. What level it needs to get to. So I mean if. So like right now we 
have Internet throughout the property. So if it's an Internet issue, that's not something 
that we can handle. We have to then send it to the support or the It company to have them 
look into it and see why the internet's not working. If it's. Issues with the apartment, 
like the maintenance side, if it's like plumbing and things like that, of course, we could 
take care of it. But the technology side, you know, even with our security deposits, we 
have a company that pretty much handles our security deposits for us. So sometimes there's 
issues where the residents try to go in and look at their deposits. And it's not 
reflecting. Correctly or you know, they're not able to log in, so. We just advise them. You 
got to contact support. That's a login issue. So I think that's. The main thing is I take 
care of what I can, but for the most part, most of it. Support. In regards to logging in or 
troubleshooting and things like that. That's something that. We don't have the knowledge on 
or we're not. Able to access that information for them. I think the biggest thing is as 
residents, what I've come to find out is that I think a lot of the residents think that we 
are the person to go to for that rather than contacting. That specific service provider. To 
troubleshoot it for them. We just contracted, whereas the company that comes in is the one 
that's, you know, the main contact person for problems, you know, but I always like to know 
because then I follow up and say, you know, was your issue resolved? Did you, you know, get 
help from the support team? Was that, you know. Problem resolved? Or is it still pending. 
And then I will then contact them and say, hey, this resident reached out to you guys, you 
know, a couple days ago, it's still not resolved with the status on it because overall 
satisfaction, I think, is, you know, the number one thing. 


Yeah. Thank you. That's very helpful to kind of get all of that context. I'm gonna shift 
gears a little bit. And talk more about. Have us talk more about iotas and smart home 
technology. But before we do, I kind of I just want to get a better sense of. Your 
perception and how you think about that. For your particular building. Why don't you talk 
to me about what iota's adt Products you're building uses. 


So right now. For iotas, we have. The. Thermostat, the smart, thermostat. We have the 
keyless, door, entry, locks. The interchangeable. Outlets. The switches, the light 
switches. And then the door sensors. So like the front door sensors. Just those five items. 


What has your experience. Using iota's products been like. 


I'll be honest at first when they first introduced. And we had to start installing it. We 
had a very big problem with internet connectivity here on my property. We had. 

How do I explain? So when they first installed the Internet for the community. There's an 
issue with connectivity, where the residents had to sign in on a page and accept some terms 
and conditions, and then it would give them access to the Internet, but then that Internet 
would automatically sign them off after a while. So long story short, they had to 
completely scrap that network and make a new network that bypass that. And we dealt with 
that for months and months. Again, I'll be honest. And the amount of complaints I got from 
residents because of the Internet, and you know, we're making it required. Was really 
tipping me over the edge. And so at that same time, we were trying to do the smart home 
installations. And the first one we were doing it was in my model. But we had a hard time 
connecting the hub. To the internet and getting everything connected on board. So we 
finally did end up doing that. But I needed to have. One of my maintenance guys from 
another property come over with a. 

Like a Wi Fi adapter. We couldn't even use the WiFi. For. The property. So he had to do 
that in order to connect all the equipment in the apartment. But once he had it, you know, 
working the connection was really quick. It was easy to set up and everything. And then 
now, of course we can we can use it. But I think that the main issue was just trying to 
have. The smart hub, connect to the you know, to the apartment, into our tablet in order to 
connect everything. So I. Haven't. Been able to. Follow up with that because there's 
equipment that we need before we try to continue the installation process. But I know 
there's this whole transition period right now. So I haven't been able to see if it's 
improved since the new network's been up and running. And there's been a, you know, some 
changes in that. But that was my main issue here on the property. Getting. The connection 
of the smart equipment to the hub into the network and getting all that up and running 
properly 


gotcha. Yeah. No, that sounds like a lot trying to figure out. I'm curious. I know you said 
that. Like you're still trying to figure out installation. What percentage of your units 
are currently kind of set up with iotis and what percentage isn't. 


So with the smart home, I would say so we have a 182 apartments here. I would say it's 
probably only like 3% because we've only got. Seven Apartments that had the Smart home. And 
of those seven, I think five are fully. Equipped with the equipment. With shorts on. And so 
I was waiting on another order. 

One of the apartments doesn't have the outlets in there because we ran out of outlets and 
then. Another one has just a couple of outlets where it needs, like, two more. I would say 
just. It's whatever the percentage of seven units to the 182 that we have on the property. 
So I haven't done much more. I won't make you do math. Yeah. I mean, I could do it. 


Yeah. Have you heard from the residents in those units? Kind of how their experience has 
been once, kind of over that initial connectivity issue with the internet. 


Yeah, so. To clarify with that those original seven were actually synchronized and set up. 
With IoT sba. They had a team of, like, three or four guys that came in to do those. The 
models we did. We tried to do inhouse and that's where we kind of had the problem. But 
those seven that were done. Again we ran out of equipment. So. That was like our initial 
batch of equipment. So they had the guys come out and do those and set those up in the 
setup was fine. The residents. Don't have any issues with the equipment and how they're 
using it. I haven't got much more feedback other than that. But. Yeah, I think. So we 
clarify. The only issue I had and our team had with Connecting was our model. But that's 
because we wanted to showcase the model in order to sell the product to prospects and so on 
and so forth. 


And right now, is it something where. Is the plan to kind of add smart home units, you 
know. To as individuals kind of sign up and choose that or is that something that you're 
trying to kind of eventually do property wide. 


Yeah. The goal is to have it property wide. I know we originally wanted to do it for every 
single person that moves in, they're gonna have that smart home equipment installed. And 
then every time somebody renews their lease and, you know, we bump them up, you know, to 
the new renewal rate with the Internet and all that stuff. To them go back and install the 
smart home equipment in their apartments as well. So the whole community at one point. 
Would be a smart community, so everybody would be able to have access to the equipment and 
use their phones to do you know everything that they need to do. 


Got you. Okay. So that's kind of the ultimate goal, just kind of a rolling it out. Unit by 
unit, it sounds 


like. Gradually. Yeah. So I mean it's, you know, I think. Originally. The way that I would 
have it done would be like in one year's time rotation, we would have every apartment, you 
know, set up with the smart equipment. Either. On their lease renewal or if it's vacant and 
somebody knew it was and we have that Putin input in there because they don't want to renew 
and they're gonna move out. We'll then, you know, install the equipment. 


I'm curious. Kind of what. Kind of what's the goal that you guys see behind. You know, 
ruling. That smart adding that smart technology. That smart home technology. To your units. 
Like what kind of prompting that decision. 


That's a decision that was made by the upper management. My owner and my regional manager, 
I think mainly because we just want to stay up with the Times and a lot of other 
communities. Have smart equipment the ease. To you know, I know we were doing the leak 
detection equipment, which you know for us will help us out with cost and overall, you 
know, like water heater leaks or 18 unit leaks so that potential damages are minimized. And 
then the smart equipment would help. In the same aspect where residents are able to say, 
oh, did I turn off the life or did you know, did I forget to turn my AC back up when I 
left? So I think it's just a good amenity to have for people, especially nowadays, because 
technology has just continually advancing. And if we can stay on top of that, it'll. Be a 
benefit to us. And a lot easier for us to sell. Our product to you know future residents 
and renters. 


Gotcha. Yeah. Thank you. That makes a lot of sense. So it sounds like there's definitely 
benefits to the residents. But also kind of coming down from higher up is that ultimate. 
Decider that decision. Are there any benefits. Or challenges. Benefits or challenges. For 
you and your staff and your role with kind of adding smart home technology to your 
properties. 


Benefits on our end. Yeah, because. If all of our apartments did have that smart equipment 
in it. You know one of. The biggest. Benefits I think would be that when the apartment is 
vacant and we have contractors in these apartments to be able to remotely. Make sure that 
the lights have been turned off so are they in electric cost is down. Same thing with the 
AC units is to make sure that those units aren't being, you know, dropped down to. 70 
degrees or lower, and making sure that the temperature again vacancy. Utility costs, I 
think is always a big thing because we have 182 apartment, so it's hard for us to check at 
the vacant on a daily basis. If you know, my maintenance guys have, you know, a lot of work 
on their plate or I do too. So I think it would help reduce the cost there. And then. Other 
than that, I mean, that's probably the only benefit I could think for. You know management 
side is being able to track that. 


Yeah, and today. How do you kind of track. Vacancies and adjusting, you know, thermostats 
if needed and that type of thing. 


Well today. It would be me just deciding to get out of the office and get some fresh air 
and stretch my legs. Go walk the units and then see if the electrics on and see what you 
know, if I walk in and I get a shiver down my spine. I know somebody's. Dropped AC allowed 
a little too much so that's the only way other than that it would be if I look at. The. 
Because we you know, I see. The electric bills. So if I see an electric bill for a vacant 
apartment, it's higher than normal. Then I'm going to be like, okay, something's going on 
here. You know, there's either the lights have been on for a whole week, or the AC has been 
cranked down too low. And then, you know, that's when I would talk to my main and 
supervisor and say, hey, what's going on with this? You know, did we have a bunch of 
contractors. In there working, you know, and sometimes we do because we're doing a remodel. 
And, you know, there's floors that are getting replaced and, you know, they're in there and 
they're using power tools and, you know, big equipment. So and in that regard, I would, you 
know, look the other way. But for the most part, it's just me getting out of the office 
and, you know, checking and seeing auditing pretty much 


gotcha yeah. So that sounds like that would be a very different experience to kind of 
glance at a screen to see, you know, those utilities or vacancies versus. Taking a stroll 
around the property. Well, thank you so much for that. We're actually going to kind of 
shift gears now again. And we're gonna be doing. An activity where the goal of this 
activity is to have a better understanding of what is most important to you. And so I'm 
going to be sharing a list of needs that you might have in your job. And I'm gonna ask you 
to plot them on this pyramid. So at the top of the pyramid is where you're gonna put what 
you need the absolute most. So it can be something from our list. Or if there's something 
that we haven't thought of. But you only get one. Absolute top need. And so then the rest 
of these needs will kind of filter down. Sort in their priority so most important to have 
near the top. Least important towards the bottom. And so I'll Zoom in, read through those. 
And then you'll just kind of talk to me about kind of where you feel. These needs. Kind of 
rank for you and priority. 


Okay. 


So we'll read through them. Make the tasks I complete on a daily basis, easier to do. 
Helpless. Identified optimizations to save money and increase efficiency. Ensure residents 
feel safe and protected. Ensure myself and other property staff feel safe and protected. 
Help us make our buildings feel like a community. Make communicating with my team and with 
residents easier. Help us attract new clients. Help us retain existing residents. New 
residents, not clients, help us retain existing residents. Are there any needs on there 
that you think of that aren't included. 


You put me on a spot. I can't think of that. Give me a minute. I'll probably come. As we do 
this. If you think of one feel free to tell me then like. All right. 


Okay. But now I will put you on the stop spot. And I will ask you to tell me of these. 
Needs which one for you is that ultimate top most important need. 


Read them through again real quick. 


Do you see them? Well enough. I can Zoom in if 


needed. Yeah, I could see it. Yeah, it's good. 


And feel free to kind of like, talk out loud. I'd love to hear your thought process, like 
if you're struggling between a few or. Love to kind of hear all of that. 


I feel like, you know, the safety part of it, you know, even. Though residents and property 
staff. You know, personally, I feel like this should kind of be hand in hand, you know, 
like it's hard to say, like the residents over me or my staff. I feel like it would be 
equal. I would want everyone to be safe, you know, equally. So it'd be difficult to choose 
one or the other because, you know, it's like she's in, you know, who's gonna live or who's 
gonna die kind of thing. You know, I would say a resident just life isn't just as important 
as one of my property staff. 


If I had to make you choose. 


Well obviously I have. More of a relationship with my staff. So I would probably say my 
staff because, you know, of course. If you know. Something happened to them. I feel more 
responsible because, you know. It would be on our shoulders, you 


know. Yeah. All right. So now that we have that first hard decision done. And luckily, it's 
hopefully not life or death in this pyramid. It's not in the pyramid. Talk to me then about 
what those next two slightly less important needs are. 


Then I go with the residence, feeling safe and protected. And then I'd probably say, help 
us identify optimizations to save money, increase efficiency. 


Then our next line down. We have three open spots. 


Retaining existing residents attracting new residents. And then. Making a building Feel 
like a community. 


Okay. So then that leaves us with. Make the tasks I complete on a daily basis easier to do, 
and make communicating with my human residents easier. That will go under. You could live 
without it. So what I'll do now is I'll Zoom out a little bit, and then you tell me if 
there's any that you feel like actually you want to shuffle around a little bit. 


Okay. 


So we have here at the top and sure myself another property staff feels safe and protected. 
Next level down ensure residents feel safe and protected. Help us identify optimizations to 
save money and increase efficiency. Below that helping us retain and attract residents, 
help us make our buildings feel like a community, and then the very bottom make 
communicating with our team easier, our residence easier and make the tasks I complete on a 
daily basis, easier to do. 


So I probably swap the. Optimizations to save money. With. The building feeling like a 
community. 


Okay. So this you would move a little bit more important. And then move this one down. So 
talk to me about kind of. What prompted that flop. 


Well because if. You if you have the buildings feel like a community and everyone's like 
getting along. I think that will kind of go hand in hand with. Retaining residents because 
they're more, you know, they're happier in the community. You know, being neighborly and 
you know. Getting involved with stuff. So I think that's important if you can. Complete 
that it will kind of go hand in hand with. Increasing the efficiency and saving money 
because you retain residents more frequently than. Your turn costs will be dropped so 
you'll save money at the same time. So I think that that would be a very important thing to 
do. And that'll if we focus on that the other two that are on the level below, we'll kind 
of go hand in hand with it and help it out. 


Gotcha okay. So it sounds like that, you know, by kind of. Creating an atmosphere where 
residents want to continue their lease. Not saving money. For not having to. Get new 
residents and do the new everything. Got it. Okay. Awesome. Well, if that looks good, I'm 
gonna move on to our. Last activity. Let me. Get there. Okay. So we've kind of talked about 
needs what I want to talk now about. Our. Potential features. So. We have a list of 
potential features that IoT. Could add into the product experience. And so I'm going to 
have you sort these features. Into categories. This time the categories we have. Our. 
Candy. So with this feature bring temporary joy but in the long run. Not have meaningful 
benefits. Or would this feature be a vitamin? Meaning it makes things better, but it isn't 
essential. Or would this feature be a painkiller? Meaning it will solve a painful problem. 
So we'll kind of take one at a time. And as we read through these potential features, tell 
me, you know, for you where each of those features. Fall under these categories. So the 
first one we have is residents receive Proactive notifications with recommendations based 
on their behavior. For example, on average, three lights remain on without any motion from 
830 to 04:00 p.m. Why don't you create an out for the day routine. 

So for that one, where would that fall for you? Candy temporary. But joy, but not lasting 
benefits. Vitamins makes things better but isn't essential or pin killers. It falls for a 
painful problem. 


I think that would probably be a vitamin. 


Our next one is your team enjoys using the dashboard because the experience is easy to use 
and beautiful. 


That's probably a candy. 


Then we have residents are able to monitor energy and water usage for their unit and 
receive notifications about usage. 


Let's get that one. Let's go. 


All right. We can come back. Residents can shop for and add new devices. Preapproved by 
your team. 


If that would be a vitamin as well. 


Residents have enhanced routine options like weather driven routines or other or ones based 
on who is home. 


So. I want to make sure I understand the. Different Three options. So this would be like a 
candy would be something that you're saying, like. Pretty much. It'd be great to have in an 
as a feature. But you know, not something that we want long term. 


More like this would be, you know, a feature that's, you know, fun. Hey, that was fun to 
use, but does that feature itself. Provide kind of meaningful benefits. 


Gotcha okay. All right. So I think that would be a candy then. 


Yeah. Okay. Then we have residents can set up other home utilities through their iota shop 
like electric or internet provider that type of thing. 


I would say that. I would say that's probably a bit. 


Then we have your team has access to industrywide and marketwide data related to 
multifamily homes. 


I would say vitamin. 


The next one is property. Staff can communicate with residents and other team members via 
an app. 


So. I feel like that's tricky, because I mean, we have a community yet. So. We wouldn't 
need like a second one. But I mean, it is important to have that community be able to 
communicate. So if we didn't have our community app, then I think that would be a 
painkiller, because that's something. Because you do have to be able to communicate with 
your residents and like a massive way like be able to talk to everyone at once. Yeah. 

Like I said, it's a toss up. I feel like between that and a vitamin because. I want to make 
sure, like, if this is something that you guys are getting my input career, an app that you 
are creating. Then. You know a lot of other management companies. Have. Apps already 
through third parties that they use and I don't know. You know they would want to stop 
using them to use yours. So. It's hard for me to answer them. 


Just answer it for you right again. No right or wrong answers and thinking specifically 
about. This feature. Within. You know, an iota app. So with that context kind of where 
would that play fit for you. 


I'll put that as a painkiller. Then. 


All right. Then we have. Residents enjoy using the app because the experience is easy to 
use and beautiful. 


Also, I think. Ease of apps are definitely important. You know, too much stuff, makes it 
confusing, and people get frustrated 


for sure. Okay. This next one is your team has access to property specific data insights 
that help determine your property health. 


But that is a painkiller. 


And then we have. Your team can receive eventbased alerts like. Hey, there's a water leak 
or there's a break in. 


That would be a painkiller. Also. 


Okay. And then I'm going to make you go back to that. One we tucked away. Residents are 
able to monitor energy and water usage for their unit and receive notifications about 
usage. 


That's a vitamin. 


So are there any features that came up as we were doing this. That we haven't included. 


Not that I can think of. 


Okay. So one question I have for you is. In terms of thinking of an easy to use and 
beautiful. App, experience. We have residents that experience being in painkillers, and we 
have kind of the teams more up and candy talk to me about why. Residents and your team like 
why that's a different. Kind of category for that experience. 


Because. When it comes to the team and using stuff, it doesn't. It doesn't have to be 
pretty and beautiful. I mean. We're here. To, you know, provide a service in the training 
if the training is done properly. I've used all kinds of system where it's like real simple 
and then some that are more complex. And as soon as you do it enough, you'll get it down 
and it will you know, it's not going to be a problem. So I think when it comes to, you 
know, our team using something. Even if it's more integrated either I personally always 
prefer. Like the more detail, the more. Stuff that you can do. The better because. You'll 
have more options. 

The way that I am. I'm I play around with things so I can learn it more intricately. And 
I'll, you know, see. What can I what kind of reports can I pull? How can I edit this to do 
that? And things like that. So when it comes to a resident, on the other hand, they don't 
have the patience, you know, for that kind of stuff sometimes. So they just want they want 
to be able to go in, get to where they gotta go and be done with it, you know, and move on. 
I don't think that too many people. When it's an amenity for their apartment or something, 
they're trying to do it's quick. Get to the point they want to get in and get out, do what 
they got to do. Exit the app. Go on to continue watching tiktoks or whatever they do. 


I think. Yeah. I think you sum that up great. That's awesome. If you had to put iotas into 
one of these categories, you know, is iotis candy? Is it vitamins or is it a painkiller. 


So when you say I owe it, if you just mean like the Smart Home Equipment or yeah, that 
Smart Home Equipment, the app that you know that the residents use the property dashboard. 


All of that. Experience and service. Right now, where does that fall for you? Is that, you 
know, bringing temporary joy, but not necessarily meaningful benefits. It makes things a 
little better, but it's not essential, or it's solving a painful problem. 


I think it's a vitamin at the end of the day. It's something that it does make life easier. 
But people can always, you know, not have that option and still just be able to be like, 
oh, I got to make sure I turn off the lights and poorly, or I got to turn out on the AC. 
It's something that will make things be better. But it's not something that, you know, you 
know, they really have to have because. You know, at the end of the day, there's still a 
lot of houses and apartments and stuff that don't have this, and people get along just 
fine. 


Got it? Yeah. Thank you. And the last minute or so do I have any questions from the 
observer before observers? Before we wrap up. 

I'm going to take that as a no. I'm going to move forward. In the last 30 seconds if you 
had to leave us with one piece of advice as we continue trying to improve the iota's adt 
experience. What advice would you leave us with. 


I would just say. The ease of connectivity and then. Support. You know, if somebody reaches 
out because they're, you know, having issues. That. Time a timely response. And resolution 
is completed, or even a follow up on that. That's the that's the main. Advice I would have 
to give just because. Of previous experiences. I think that could do a lot and help a lot. 
It would help brand. And you know, make responses. And you know, satisfactory marks, you 
know, go up and then also help out management team because if the responses done in a 
timely manner and the resolutions completed, it'll make the residents happy. And which will 
then help us. You know, because if they're happy, we're happy. You know, we don't want to 
have to hear about their complaints about, you know, why Stuff's not working and then just 
say, I'm. You know, I'm sorry. It's not in our power. To, you know, fix whatever it is. 
We've already reached out. So I think that is the main thing is having support. You know 
be. Responding in a sufficient amount of time in making sure that any issues are resolved 
as well. 


Yeah. Thank you so much. This has been so great to speak with you, and I appreciate you 
know, you being willing to reschedule and meet a little bit early. I hope that you enjoy 
your time off next week. Thank you. Thank you. I'll send you an email. You should receive 
your incentive digitally. And. We appreciate you meeting with us today. 


Thank you, Karen. Thank you. Observers. All right, bye.
 
Dave interview
In the property management industry. Changes with 
the wind with the minute with the day. I will say 
consistently. In my industry, every single thing 
that I do every single day is solve problems. So 
Monday through fridays is what I work. But you might 
have a flood in an apartment at 10:00 at night. And 
you got a dispatch vendors and go through crisis 
management and things like that. So it changes on a 
daily basis. Yeah, no. We are definitely gathering 
that sense. I'm curious. Kind of what are different 
things that, you know. Interrupt your routine. 


Okay. Personal Routine, or Professional 


routine. Professional. And if professional 
interruptions interrupt personal. That's helpful to 
know, too. 


Yeah. Yep. So. I could have a goal that I am going 
to. Today. For example. So yesterday when I went 
home, I realized that or not realized I was. 
Thumbing through my day for today and what I needed 
to do and realize I've got four apartments that need 
residents are moving into today. I've got three 
apartments that residents are moving out of. So the 
first thing I did this morning when I got here is I 
went to walk those two. The two I went to walk two 
of the four move ins that were occurring today. I go 
there. I realized there's a smoke detector that 
hasn't been installed. Then I have to pick up the 
phone and call maintenance and say the smoke 
detector's not installed. Or the tub diverter hasn't 
been put on the tempo set and we need to backtrack 
on this. Then they have to run depot. Get that part. 
Come back, install it. We have to enter a purchase 
order number. For that and then hopefully that 
person. Can still move in by 10:00. 

Another wrench that brew it in was another apartment 
I realized this morning, and they were supposed to 
move in. They still haven't signed a document that's 
part of their least contract, so having to chase 
them down, then. One of the residents. Their phone 
is acting up, so now they have to find another phone 
or find another alternative and ipad to be able to 
sign their documents, things like that. 


So many moving parts. And I'm curious. You know, it 
sounds like. You know, there's definitely a lot of 
kind of face to face with a resident. I'm curious, 
kind of who else do you kind of typically 
communicate with at work. 


My assistant manager. My leasing consultants. Are 
maintenance team typically in the morning I have to 
meet with. My maintenance supervisor just to 
download him on what's going on for the day. That 
way. I call it our same page meeting. We're all on 
the same page. So he knows exactly what's going on. 
I know it exactly what's going on. We know what our 
expectations are for that day. And that way we at 
least have. A solid base of what needs to be 
accomplished. And then when we get these wrenches 
thrown into it, we can accommodate and adjust 
accordingly. 


Gotcha. And then. In terms of kind of building. 
Owner, operator, that type of thing. How. Often. Do 
you typically communicate with them. 


The 


owner. 


Every day. Every single day. And it could be about 
small things. Like we've got a seven $6000 pool, 
full renovation going on right now. Where we're 
resurfacing our cool deck. So I'm talking with 
Project manager. For. The management company which 
is also our own. To debrief them on what's going on. 
And we found a leak today that's in our pool, that 
water is not holding. So we have to drain the pool 
again this morning. This is all this morning. Drain 
the pool again. Realize we found the League. We have 
to seal it. Repair it. Fill it up. Hopefully the 
water will hold. Every day every day. I'm helping 
with the averse, or at least somebody from my 
ownership group in. The flowchart. 

I had a review come in from. Google this morning. 
And it was from somebody who I believe is a former 
employee that we terminated his employment or, as I 
say, freed up its future. 

And. It said Maintenance. The lights never worked. 
The gates always broken. So I just knew when the 
username that I believe this is that employee, that 
I terminated that in October. And so I linked my 
regional manager in and let her know. And then she 
said, oh, we terminated him. Or you think that's 
him. Reach out to reach out to HR and make HR aware. 
I had to draft the response. To that Google review 
to do damage control. Because he's a disgruntled 
employee or former employee that things didn't work 
out for his future with us. So he's trying to blast 
us, so had to draft that and have to make. Hr aware. 
And she's looking through all of her records to see. 
You know. Could this possibly be him making those 
notes that he you could go to other Properties, 
websites or Google Pages and blast them as well. So. 
Yeah. 


A lot of fires that you're putting out. And so with 
that, you know, communicating with you know, the 
owner, the operating group managing group. Is that 
kind of the. Primary topic is kind of keeping them 
informed about all the different things are coming, 
or they're like more like regular topics that you 
check in on as well. 


No. I mean. I've been in an executive role with the 
management company in the past. And I know kind of 
what is important. And I call it high level or 
40,000 40,000ft in the air. You know, they don't 
need to necessarily know about the minutia that's 
going on. Where you've got? Oh, this shrub is dying. 
They don't need to know that or. You know. There's a 
dead duck that was found in the middle of the road. 
They don't mean to know about that. They need to 
know about the things that are going to impact their 
bottom line. They're gonna need to know about the 
things that are going to either lose money. For 
their investment or their enemy, or they're going to 
need to know what's going to make that money. And 
all those all those things that I've put out today 
have been, you know, you could have an unhappy 
resident that moves into that apartment that doesn't 
have to have different. Detectors missing. They're 
upset because within the first, you know, hour, then 
being in that apartment, they've already determined 
if they want to continue living here. For another 
year after they've lived here. That could impact the 
bottom line. The pool, the pool having a leak, and 
that's not determining and defining where where that 
leak the source of the leak is coming from could 
affect the bottom line because you might have a 
pissed off resident that can't use the 100 square 
foot bulldeck that we've got overlooking a 36 acre 
Lake. And they're upset because. They got a pool. 
They feel like they're painful rent, even though 
they're not. But. That all could affect the bottle 
nine. So. It's all those things. That. 

I'll handle everything that I can on a surface 
level. And keep it, keep it. Handled. But when it 
gets to 40. 0ft in the air. Where the ownership grew 
or the ownership entity or the executive team needs 
to be aware what's going on. That's what I make most 
definitely. 


No, that makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you 
kind of almost triage everything and try to figure 
out what all needs to happen. 


Well. That I would look at somebody. And I would 
say. I don't need to be made aware of this. You've 
got it handled. You've got to handle, so just handle 
it. That's why I hired you. And that's why I trusted 
you. You don't need to run that by me, do we need to 
replace the stroke? Just do it's. A $40 shrub. Just 
do it. 


Yeah. For sure. Well, and would you say that I know 
a lot of those kind of bottom line examples you 
gave. Have to do kind of. Specifically it seems like 
with resident experience. Are there other. 
Categories that you would put things that have like 
an impact on the bottom line? Or is it. Resident 
experience. 


I would say resident experience would probably be 
about 16, 70%. Of. The focus. And I would say. 30% 
would be the investment in maintaining the 
investment. You've got a brief leak in a building. 
Two, for example. And you don't take care of that 
roof leak. That's also going to trickle down, no pun 
intended. Down into resident experience, because if 
you don't take care of that resident experience, 
it's going to go down, they're going to get upset. 
They're gonna go in social media and say, bad 
maintenance, ruthless leak for 66 weeks and don't 
live here, which then. Affects our reputation. 
Apaths are moving. It affects you know our damage to 
do. 

Actually, I would take that back. The resident 
experience is probably 70%. And the maintaining is 
probably also 70% as well. So at about 140% of stuff 
that I've got to do. 


Oh, man. 


Yeah? And just whatever comes in between. And just 
just handle it. I've been doing this 24 years now, 
so. 

I'm not phased by anything anymore. 


Yeah, you're like dead deck in the road. Good. Duck 
in the road. Naked man swimming in the pool. Yeah, 
it's fine. Get out of the pool. So with all the 
things that you're keeping track of, especially as 
you were talking about, you know, like all the 
things that you and your assistant manager are kind 
of keeping track of and extra things popping in. Are 
there any tools that you use at work that you find 
to be helpful or tools that you have, but maybe 
don't necessarily use. So thinking about specific 
names of programs or tools like that. 


So. Our platform, our software that we use for our 
property management software is one site Real page. 
And one site real page is. I'm pretty well versed in 
it. And I've worked for. 

Companies in the past that have totally used put all 
of their eggs in the basket to use that platform. 
Where it was beneficial to me because I knew how to 
do the accounts payable portion where the accounts 
payable piece of that software and you have to do 
the facilities piece of that software. I know how to 
look at the accounting. Piece of that software. And 
you have to do. 

The resident communication, which goes into resident 
resident retention. Communicating and texting and 
emailing the residents. And all of that the online. 
Online nowadays everybody's using the docusign or 
electronic signature. Pieces of things just to 
eliminate paper. You know, a gogreen initiative. 

In my previous previous roles in previous lives at 
other companies have benefited because I've been 
able to use those platforms. To whereas when I 
joined the company with now. Three, three and a half 
years ago, they were just using a little piece of 
little piece of it something as simple as. Online 
leasing online leasing apartments, you know, sending 
sending your guests that walks into Lisa Department 
a link where they can go ahead and fill out their 
application. You know. I showed up three, three and 
a half years ago. With this company. When I walked 
in, I looked at the leasing consultants, and I said, 
So, what are you guys doing all day? What takes up 
most of your time? And they said, just entering all 
this data from this application, this person filled 
out a week and a half ago, and I entered the Social 
Security number wrong. And I was like, Whoa, Whoa, 
Whoa, Whoa. You don't need to do that. I said, let 
me find a way. Where you can drive the customer with 
a guest to fill out their own application. That way, 
if they put that they only make $4,000 a year. The 
error of burden or error of proof is on them, not 
you. And so. I was pleased to say that I was the 
first property at 29 Properties that my company. 
Manages. That started the online application. And I 
didn't even tell anybody what's doing. You know, I 
was. I was debbing it, digging into it and seeing 
what where can I go on this website to fill out an 
application? And I found it. I said, send people. 
These links. Send people. These links. They started 
rolling in. So. I know for a fact that I probably 
have a dartboard with my face on it at every office 
in our company because they're like another 
initiative that Dave is rolled out and blah, blah, 
blah. In the grand scheme of things, all those 
platforms that I've been accustomed to using in the 
past, I'm able to bring to the table. And. Some of 
my colleagues with the company are appreciative 
about it because we took it. We as a company, and 
all of us have taken it from this level all the way 
to this level. So did that answer your question? 


It did. Yeah. It was helpful. And I'm gonna ask you 
to kind of rate on a scale of one to five where one 
is much worse and five as much improved. How 
improved is your day to day work life based on the 
technology you have supporting you. 


What was the rating? One to five. 


Yeah. One being much worse. Five being much 
improved. 


Totally, Totally, five. 


And talked to me about kind of how. Technology makes 
your life or your job easier. 


So for example. The smart home system that we rolled 
out here. I believe it was almost two years ago. 

Was also. A. Game changer for our company again. I 
hate to say it. I was the first to do the Smart Home 
technology. That we rolled out here. At the 
community within our company. So I was the gaining 
pig. That was the pilot. I was a spearhead. We had 
alarm systems. For probably 20 years. And when we 
looked at the data and I wanted the statistics to. 
See, tell me of all of these all of these 402 
apartments that we've got at how many have activated 
alarms. And it was 5%. So they're paying for an 
alarm system and an alarm feature in their 
apartment. But at a really bad at math. At a 5% to 
402, we have 20 people at their alarm set. Nobody 
used it. So I decided to look into what can we take 
it to the next level to upgrade? Are there newer 
alarms that we can do. Are there. Ring doorbells 
that we can do? Are there green cameras that we can 
do just to make people feel more secure? What made 
no sense to actually piggyback on the alarm piece of 
it because. Only 20%. We're using it. Right. So 
that's when we rolled out the Smart, Smart Home 
technology. 

And I thought it was going to be like a huge 
undertaking, rewiring all this stuff. But because we 
already had the piece, I guess for the alarm and the 
infrastructure for the alarm into each of our 
methods just seamless to be able to go and install 
the smart box and saw the smart lights, which. 
Install the garage door openers. Install the 
thermostat and the hubs that are on the wall for the 
for the residents to use. And. They probably started 
on April 1 or and now they probably started on April 
14. By May 24, the following month, the whole 
property was smart. The whole property was smart. 
And I like it from an aspect that. My maintenance 
staff. Don't have to come in in the morning. And sit 
there and let's say they've got 20 work orders in 
their hand and they don't have to go to the keybox 
as. It's called in the old school industry. The key 
box and grab this key for apartment one on one. This 
keeper. 202. This keeper part of our 303 and then 
match them up with work orders. And then God forbid 
they get mixed up because they've got a different 
number on them because if you lose the key, you 
don't want somebody know. And that's the key to two 
of one. But having that piece where I can give all 
of my team members. The access to the app where they 
can go in and say, okay, I'm going to. Unlock you 
know. Is a timesaver it's a game changer. It's. That 
part of the technology is great, too. It's also 
great because you've got the Big Brother features. I 
call it. Somebody that has not paid rent in four 
months. I can then go into their activity and say, 
okay. They haven't entered their apartment 25 days. 
Are they still there. Am I going to Can I go ahead 
and take constructive possession of that apartment. 
In contact the power company to see if they've taken 
the power out of their name. You know all those 
puzzle pieces help us to identify. If we've got 
people that are squatters are deadbeats. Not that I 
have swaters, but I do have people that have paid 
rent. And I can then contact that person and say, 
look, you haven't accessed your apartment in 25 
days. You're under eviction. Do you want to just go 
ahead and give up possession? Because at the end of 
the day it's gonna be better if you did fight apart. 
But back to me. Instead of sitting on it for two 
more months and increasing that balance of four 
months wrench. And that's six months. So that 
technology piece. It's a game changer. It's a game. 


It sounds like it's helped in a variety of ways. I'm 
curious. You know, you said with the previous alarms 
it was, you know, 5% of residents usage. How have 
residents responded to this rollout of the new Smart 
technology. 


So they initially had said. So because we charged. 
$25 to each resident for the alarm. 

That they weren't using. We were banking our revenue 
of about $600 a year per apartment times $402 as far 
as revenue for a feature that residents in the needs 
they didn't see it valuable. They're just paying it 
because we told them to. So going into the resident 
experience. When we started. Exploring the option. 
Of increasing the. Amenity feature. For the Smart 
Home experience. They looked at us and they said, 
no, no. You're already charging is $25 for. This 
alarm that I don't even use, and you're now going to 
raise it to $45 or $50. For this feature. When I 
didn't even use the alarm, I was like, look, you're 
not. It's not the alarm anymore. It's not the alarm. 
First of all, we're not a community that you have to 
worry about. Probably had one apartment break in in 
the past 20 years. Not going. 

So having to roll that out to the residents and 
pitch that. Was. Tough, However. It was also when we 
when we when we did the installation in April to May 
of. Two years ago, when we did that rollout, there's 
people who are paying the $25, but their least isn't 
expiring until the following March. When you go to a 
car dealership and you want to buy a car. And the 
salesperson says, you know what, why don't you fill 
out this paperwork? Go ahead and take the car home, 
driving around for two days. You take it home, you 
drive it around for two days, take it back to the 
dealership. And you're like, I really, really want 
this car because my crappy Nissan sentra. It. I 
don't like it. I want this Accord. So it was a try 
before you buy. Approach that I've used in the past 
or renovations I've used it for. This. A try before 
you buy, let them experience it, let them see the 
value of it. Let them see that they're not having to 
walk into their apartment or walk up to their 
apartment door and fumble through their keys when 
they have grocery that they can actually say, hey, 
siri, open my front door. 

Trust me, that wasn't a pitch of any sort, but. It 
was that giving that resident that experience, that 
time to see it. And see the value in it to be able 
to use this joke all the time. With. Older females 
that come in and I'm telling them about the smart 
home and thermostat. Girl, you could be in menopause 
and you don't have to get out of your bed when 
you're having a hot flash to adjust that thermostat. 
Go your phone, adjust it, get it cool, whatever you 
want to do. And they laugh. They were like, yes, 
Yes. 

That sold it. And then I thought that I would have 
my senior residents. That are in the age group. That 
they would be like, no, no, I still use my flipfill. 
Nobody uses flip phone? Nobody is wax machine. 
You're going to be a smart. You're gonna have a 
smartphone. So everybody has a smartphone at some 
point in time. So you you had to go through that 
tutorial where you were having to pet those 
residents just a little more. But once they got it. 
They got it, man. They Miss Karen, who's a resident, 
who's a retired nurse. She's 81. I think she came 
in. She was like, I love what you have rolled out. 
At this community. I love that you rolled out and I 
was like, what do you think that's a smart home? Do 
you think about the smartphone? She's like, I love 
it. I love it. I don't have to get up to unlocked or 
I don't have to unlock the door and get my keys. 
Wait, I don't have keys anymore, you know. So it's. 
That benefit that made our job easier. The 
residents, the residents are all on board. I mean, 
we've got all residents that are paying now for the 
Smart home. My residents that moved in this morning, 
I send them a detailed letter that says These are 
the steps for the vin day. You're going to sign 
release. You're gonna pay your money. You're going 
to verify your photo ID when we click Move in in our 
system at the top of the hour, you're gonna get your 
code from adt with your six digit code and an 
invitation to download. The app. 

10:00 all dot an email giving in that information. 
About an hour and a half later. I'm in the 
apartment. Looks great. The tutor murder needs to be 
replaced. Already. On top of that, Sir. You know, 
and. It's hassle free because. It takes away granted 
the face to face experience that you're getting. But 
nowadays people don't want to look at your face. 
They want to apply online. They want to pay their 
money online. They want to, you know, get their 
stuff. Online and or are in their email and have 
access to whatever they need to have access to. Then 
if they need us, they come see us. Yeah, then I 
solved their problem. 


Well, I'm curious. You know, it sounds like it's 
been a really receptive group. For your residents. 
And I'm curious, you know, I know you said that, you 
know, you've you have that dartboard, probably of 
your face somewhere of all these things that you're 
rolling out. How has your staff responded to kind 
of. The addition of the smart home, and you know, 
maybe some of the troubleshooting or onboarding that 
they have to do. 


We were just actually having troubleshooting. 
Something. Literally 1 minute before. I jumped on 
this this game call. We had today. And it was my 
leasing consultant had a resident that lives in 
Apartment, let's say 204. She's moving to Apartment 
304. That's another building away because she wanted 
more space in her apartment. One of the frustrating 
things that I've experienced. And that we experience 
today. That resident that has a username and 
password with the Smart home. For Apartment Two or 
four. She's moving into three and four today. She 
doesn't live out of two or four until Sunday because 
she needs a chance to migrate and live her stuff 
over Department 304. So she cannot have a username 
and password. Or three out of four. And she will. 
Need the partner access to two to 304 and she hadn't 
been able to get her username password. Because what 
I was told is. Just what I said. She has an email 
address that says cindy luho@yahoo.com. She needs to 
have another email address for apart three or four. 
She can't have the same email address. Which kind of 
is frustrating too, from an apartment management 
standpoint every year I have probably. 2021 I had 
one company. That is actually a competitor of ADT. 
That comes into a market and blitzes the market with 
order to our sales. And neighborhoods and things 
like that. They leave 21 apartments from me. They 
all have the same email address. It was a corporate 
apartment lease. Through a Corporation. Wasn't in 
Jun Smith, it wasn't in cindy lou. It wasn't 
Embeddy. Betty Johnson, in her name. So there was no 
way for me to get those people that were residing in 
that approach. Access. To their smart home app. All 
I could give them was a six digit code. And I know 
they're looking at me saying bullshit, because, 
look, we work for a smart home company. We it can be 
done. But I couldn't get the answer. So that was 
year one. Year two. At least 18 apartments from me. 
Same scenario, same situation. I could not give them 
their smart home access and smartphone system. This 
year, year three, I've got ten of them coming back. 
Or ten apartments that are going to be used by that 
so. It's those kind of frustrating things that we 
can't. We can't get a workaround. 

And so the resident that was moving into two from 
204 to 304, we were just talking to ADT. And she 
said she said, well. We can just we can create a 
user for her. But what's supposed to happen is when 
we click, move in in my system, my property 
management system. Is integrating with ADT. So when 
it integrates with adt at the top of the hour, 
that's when it says, okay, this person has moved in. 
We're going to move them in. We're going to send 
them their code. So. She she said we could go ahead 
and enter her as a user for Apartment 304. And we 
said we said to her, what about 204. She lives out 
on Sunday. Will that delete her access to 300. The 
only answer that we could we could get was I don't 
know. We'll see. What we do in that aspect when 
she's locked out, since we don't do lockouts for 


apartments, you know? 


So it's it's thinking through those processes and me 
also having the brain of crap what's gonna happen? 
But if this happens, what if this happens? What if 
this happens? That's going to help. To enhance that 
piece for the resident experience and also the 
client experience, you know. 


Yeah. Well, I'm curious, you know, thank you for 
kind of sharing that because that's definitely 
something that I would not have thought about. But, 
man, it makes a lot of sense. And now I'm worried 
that my brain just. Took my question. I really 
wanted to know this to hang on a second. Oh. Are 
there any features that. You would like adt to have 
or to be able to do that you can't do now I 
definitely understand about the you know, like. The 
difficulty right now with the one username with the 
one unit that type of thing. But talk to me if 
there's anything else that you think of that you 
feel like would be really beneficial if you could 
change about. Your service with adt. 


So you're talking from a client standpoint or you're 
talking from a resident experience standpoint. 


Both. I love to hear yours. You know, as a as a 
client of adt as well as if there's things with the 
resonant experience. 


Because I'm a resident. And a 


client. 


I mean. Not necessarily on the customer service 
piece or not a customer service the resident 
standpoint because. I mean everything that I see. 
From. A resident. I'm able to see as a client as 
well because I'm a super user. 

I mean, I don't I don't I don't think so. I don't 
think so. From a resident standpoint now, as a 
client. That piece that I just brought 


up. 


There's there's two pieces with adt. That. Kind of 
get. Convoluted if you will. So with adt, you've got 
the point central portal. And that's for the smart 
experience, right. For the resident. But then for 
adt, you've also got the adtesuite portion of it. 
And the adtesuite portion of it pretty much 
maintains. The Resident data in Resident 
information. And a resident's secret passcode. If 
they get locked out of their apartment, they call 
1805 five ADT ADT whatever say I'm locked out of my 
apartment at one, two, three. Bird Lover drive. And 
I need to get into my apartment ADT's then going to 
say to them, What's your four digit security code. 
That resident most likely is confused at what their 
security code is, whether it's their six digit code 
that they use to get into their front door or the 
code that they set up for years ago when they moved 
into their apartment that they don't know. And it's 
not integrated at all. So if we move somebody into 
our system through a property management software. 
And it integrates into adt point Central and sends 
that resident their code. There is no way. In from 
there. For the Esuites piece to be linking with the 
point central, either. So. That same same kind of 
piece that I was talking about with the corporate 
leases. With the ten corporate leases that we have 
coming, I can't go in to Point Central if if I have. 
A three bedroom, for example, this company is coming 
in. They're bringing six people to live in this one 
apartment. This one three bedroom apartment. I can't 
go in and enter. Observer one. Into the Esuites 
portion to give them their four digits or to let 
them generate their four digit code. I can't go in 
for observer too. I can't do it for grade because 
the most of these suites will allow. Is to account. 


Per unit, 


per unit, per unit. So what if you have a family 
that you have a husband, wife, and a daughter or son 
and another daughter. What if daughter. And 
daughters and son get locked out of their apartment. 
They have no way to get back into their apartment. 
Or ask for assistance because you can't enter their 
information. 


Yeah, well, and you may have told me this already. I 
apologize if you have. Can you remind me which 
property management software? Use 


Real Page One site. Real page. 


Okay. Awesome. Thank you. Well, I really appreciate, 
you know, all the context that you shared, and you 
know, the benefits that you've seen, as well as some 
of the challenges and frustrations. We're gonna 
change gears a little bit, and we're gonna do an 
activity where it's the goal is to kind of get a 
better understanding of what's most important to 
you. So I'm gonna share a list of needs that you 
might have in your job. And then we are going to 
have you sort them and let me pull up. Where we're 
gonna do that. 

All right. 

Are you able to see my screen? 


I sure am 


perfect and I will Zoom in and also read these out 
loud. So if it's too small, we'll still be able to 
learn about it. So at the top of this pyramid, we 
are gonna have you plot what you find is your 
absolute. Need your absolute mess. It can be 
something from this list that we've generated or 
there's something we haven't thought of you can have 
it there, but there's only room for one top need. 
And then we'll move ourselves down with most 
important near the top. And then at the bottom we 
have a space for you know, you can live without it 
type of thing. So the needs that we have to sort are 
here at the left. We have. Let me Zoom in. Make the 
tasks I complete on a daily basis easier to do. Help 
us identify optimizations to save money and increase 
efficiency. Ensure residents feel safe and 
protected. Ensure myself and other property staff 
feel safe and protected. Help us make our buildings 
feel like a community. Make communicating with my 
team and with the residents easier. Help us attract 
new residents. Help us retain existing residents. Is 
there anything that you feel like is missing from 
this list. 


I sure there is. If 


you think of it as we go about doing it, let me 
know. And I will. I'll add it to the sticky. But to 
begin why don't you go ahead and tell me. Which of 
these feels like the most important to you. 


Can I touch it and drag it? 


No. 


I'll drag it for you if you want to tell me, but if 
you also want to 


kind of talk through your, you know, kind of think 
out loud, that'd be great. 


So I would say that one of the most important things 
that would be at the top would be help to retain 
existing residents. 


And why does that get the top billing. 


Because if you don't retain residents, you don't 
make money. If you if residents move out, you're 
having to spend cost on. Turning an Apartment 
Marketing Costs Turnover cost. So if I keep the 
residents I have and I keep them happy. It's better 
on my bottom line. 


Got it. Okay. So now if we think about. Maybe a step 
down from that, you know. Absolute need. What else 
would you put in this. Important Category category. 


Like the top or the second route. 


The second row. You only get one on the top. 


Got it. I would say, help us make our building feel 
like a beginning. That's one of them. Reason for 
that is if I make our buildings feel like a 
community. Or residents feel like a community. 
They're apt to stay longer. And it feels like more 
than just an apartment. It feels like. And people 
love the word honestly. It's comforting. It's a it's 
a happy word. So and making sure that they feel like 
a community where they can actually come into the 
office and talk to talk to their staff. And you 
know. Their son could come in and hand me Hershey's 
kids. Good to see you happy Friday now that builds a 
sense of community and makes it feel like more than 
just an apartment that you're handing, handing 
somebody over $2,000 a month. For the Europeartment 
and Rent and you want to feel a community. 


I know you said, you know, you've had 24 years of 
kind of working in this field. I'm curious. Kind of 
if there are any kind of. Things that stand out to 
you that have kind of helped achieve that. Helping. 
You know, helping our buildings feel like a 
community. 


Yeah, there's so many. And it's evolved so much. 
Just. Back to it's. Just honestly, back to the 
basics. Of knowing somebody by May Calling somebody 
by name. Is. Important. As far as any tips or 
tricks, I mean email and text messaging to 
communicate with your residents, it's going to be a 
game changer. We recently rolled out about. Three 
weeks ago, maybe a month ago. It was about three 
weeks ago. Math text messaging option where we can 
text message the residents. I was working on a 
Saturday. We just rolled it out on a Friday. And I 
was working. On a Saturday, which you don't want to 
do is you don't want to send a message. It says you 
need to bring your trash can slide because rodents 
are going to come up to your door and blah, blah, so 
you're gonna be $525. They're gonna type in the word 
stop, and then you can't communicate with them via 
text anymore. So that's always been my experience. 
And not only is giving them words of gratitude, that 
Saturday that I was working. That. We just rolled it 
out a day earlier. We'll text us anytime. And I just 
sent a text message out and said, I just want to say 
thank you for being a resident here at our 
community. If you ever need anything, you'll be 
stopped by and say Hello if you just want to have a 
cup of coffee, come on by. And residents who are 
doing the thumbs up and they were liking it. And 
saying, thank you so much. We love living here. You 
know, it's just. Those little tinies. That give the 
resident experience. What it is. And you know, some 
people will come back and say, is this a bot. No, 
it's about it's, Dave. It's Dave, and I'll send a 
picture, 


you know, 


that it's me. And they're like, oh, hey, Dave, 
looking good, man, you know, so it's it's not being 
so canned as well. And doing canned answers. 

How's your dog? How's lala doing today. I saw you 
walking by the office walking lala. Or it's a 
beautiful day just so you welcome by so they 
actually say, Wow. He's watching me. Not in a bad 
way. Like he pays attention. He knows, you know, so. 
Those I mean, over 20 years. It's it's that thing 24 
years ago. It was when somebody would walk into pay 
their rent and drop the rent off. You always ask 
them How's everything in your apartment. We don't 
necessarily ask that any. But we ask other 
questions. How's your family? That was down here 
last week. You know, I saw blah, blah, blah, blah, 
blah, blah. So you got a new car? You're having that 
conversation. With them. And that interaction with 
them that provides for the ultimate customer 
experience. 


Gotcha thank you for that. I'm mindful of our time 
because I do want to make sure that. I don't keep 
you longer than you know the time we promised. So I 
will have. Asking as many followup questions. So 
when we think about this second layer here of 
importance, what other one kind of what other need 
falls there. 


Making communication with my team and with residents 
easier. 


And then we drop a level. So we're a level above. 
You could live without it. 


We're a level above. I can live without it. Which 
means I can live without it as the bear bones 
minimum. I don't care. Yeah, that's the very bottom. 
So you have three 


that you can do above that. 


Three of these which would be. Help us identify 
optimizations to save money and increase efficiency. 
Then the next one would be. Make the tasks. That I 
complete on a daily basis. Easier to do. 

And help attract new residents. 

This sounds crappy, but. I can't live. I can't live 
without ensuring residents feel safe and protective, 
because that's that's just a given. You can make 
their experience. One that makes. Them feel safe and 
ensure my staff in that property. Wow, I don't like 
to be protected in any way. 


Well so I'm gonna move these down here to your open 
spot, but if you need to swap any out so that the 
safe and protected isn't at the you could live 
without it. Let me know if there's any that you want 
to change. 


Okay. And then the blank square is just a freel, 
right? 


Yep. If you think of a need that we haven't 
mentioned. 


Drama, drama. I could live with that drama. 


Well, okay. We'll put drama here. I mean, but that's 
a need. This is a need. Do you want to drive as a 
need. 


No. Paper. People need paper. 


All Right. So are you good with. The. Feeling good 
about kind of the where everything is. 


Yes. 


Awesome. Then we will move on to our last. Activity. 
This is also going to be another kind of sorting 
one. This time we're thinking about potential list. 
I have a list of potential features that adt could 
add into the product experience. So this time 
instead of a pyramid, what we have our three 
categories. So we have. These features could be. 
Candy, where it brings temporary joy. But in the 
long run does not have meaningful benefits. It could 
be a vitamin where it definitely makes things better 
but isn't essential. Or we have painkillers, which 
solve for a painful problem. So this time, as I read 
through them, you just tell me. Which category they 
fall for you of these potential features for ADT. 
Residents receive Proactive notifications with 
recommendations based on their behavior. Example, on 
average, three lights remain on without any motion 
from 830 to four. Why don't you create an out for 
the day routine. 


What's the categories. 


So if candy, which is more temporary joy. No lasting 
benefits. Vitamins helpful but not necessary and 
then painkiller. 


Painkillers are something that I want, right? 


Yes. That solve a painful process. Of issue, 


or. Residents receive Proactive notifications. I 
would say that's candy. 


What about your team enjoys using the dashboard 
because the experience is easy to use and beautiful. 


Vitamin. 


Residents are able to monitor energy and water usage 
for their unit and receive notifications about 
usage. 


Vitamin. 


Residents can shop for and add new devices 
preapproved by your team. 


Painkiller. 


Residents have enhanced routine options like weather 
driven routines or ones based on who is home. Homeb. 
Homebas 


can set up other Home utilities through their adt 
app. Electric Internet provider. 


That would be painkiller. 


Your team has access. Oops. I need to put it in the 
right one. Your team has access to industrywide and 
marketwide data related to multifamily homes. 


Can be. 


Property staff can communicate with residents and 
other team members via an app. 


Vitamin. 


Residents can use enjoy using the app because the 
experience is easy to use and beautiful. 


Painkiller. 


Okay. Your team has access to property specific data 
insights that help determine your property health. 


Vitamin. 


All right, your team can receive event based alerts, 
like a water leak or a break in. 


Painkiller. 


Are there any potential features that we haven't 
thought of that you feel like would be helpful to 
include. 


Honestly, not at the top of my head. 


If I were to thinking of our earlier conversation, 
if I were to. Have something related to kind of the 
multiple accounts or multiple units with accounts. 
If I put that on here just based on our 
conversation. 


Yes. That would be a painkiller. 


That would be a painkiller. Okay. All right. I have 
just have a little bit left. I have one question 
about. In terms of I noticed you know, for residents 
having the app easy to use and beautiful was a 
painkiller, whereas we have. Your team. It was more 
of vitamin. Tell me briefly kind of about. Why one 
is in one category, one's in the other. 


So the Resident training. Was not as extensive as 
what the team training was. So we know the ins and 
outs. Whether a team member retains that information 
or not because they might only be looking at one 
thing all the time as a manager. I'm looking at all 
the things I'm looking at the activity. I'm looking 
at the user if I'm looking at the temperature. So 
all of our training that we did on site would be 
much more expensive. So that is why I've been having 
the data insights for the team. Would be a vitamin. 
And it would be helpful. But having the residents be 
able to set up their utilities and home utilities. 
Through the app would be. A game changer in my 
opinion, because oftentimes we get those questions 
from the resident, so it's how can I. How can I how 
can I set up my alexa device to be linked to my adt 
system. All we do is shrug our shoulders. We don't 
know how to do it. I don't know. I don't think 
that's a feature that's available. I had to search 
for the theory feature. To be able to lock my door 
and it just went through trial and error. Me having 
to do that. And then I'll send out a message. The 
email or text that says Did you know you can now 
unlock your front door via series ask us how. Or 
I'll send a screenshot so that just with me going in 
not being afraid to click that button. 

I think that would be a painkiller. To have the 
residence be able to set up their utilities or any 
other applications that 


they might have. And is that kind of similar for 
this idea of you know, them being able to. Add new 
devices, you know that. Your property has already 
kind of approved. Yes, you can have outdoor camera 
and alexa or whatever. 


Gotcha correct. 


Well, before we end, I do want to open up our time 
to the Observers that they have any questions for 
you before we finish. 


Hi, Dave. Thank you so much. This has been so 
incredibly helpful. And it's been such a pleasure 
listening to you. I had one question about that 
safety and security portion of it. I know that you 
mentioned earlier that you had that usage data that 
showed people weren't really using their alarms. I'm 
curious, as you think, about security within a 
multifamily set. Setting. 

We lost. And he hated my question. 


Oh, no. 


He was frozen. 


Hopefully he'll come back in the last couple 
minutes. I'm excited for the answer to your 
question. Emily. 


Thanks, Karen. Need that validation. 


Here we go. 


Welcome back. 


Sorry about that. My wife. I went down, tried to get 
on my hotspot. 


Don't worry at all. I was just saying, thank you. 
So, so, so much. This has been so incredibly 
helpful. And it's been a pleasure talking. Listening 
to you. My question on the Round about Safety and 
security piece. I know that you mentioned that usage 
data showed that people weren't really setting their 
alarms. And I was curious if you think about 
security. In a multifamily smartphone, multifamily 
environment. What does that look like for you in a 
way that people might actually use it. 


Say that all again. 


Yes. Thinking about 


so I have the data that shows that I had 5% of my 
residents that were actually using the security. And 
your question Gov. 


Are there security features, functionality that you 
think would be valuable. And would be used in a 
smart home, multifamily setting. 


So. When I would get asked the question. By the 
resident. Well, I'm paying for an alarm system. 
Let's say this resident threatened the alarm system. 
We're taking the rug out from under them and 
removing the alarm. Piece for them. They would say, 
Well, I don't feel comfortable anymore in my 
apartment. So I have to think of myself as a 
resident. You know, if I if I'm not at home and I've 
got a security system with the sirens that are in my 
in my apartment or the silot alarms that are in my 
apartment. Which at that point in time we have the 
sirens where the alarm would go off. 

The likelihood of somebody. Being caught that is in 
my apartment while I'm not home. Is very little and 
I use the word caught and apprehended is very 
minimal compared. To if I had an activity 
notification. On my Smart health app that says you 
have somebody that's unauthorized in your apartment. 
I could easily pick up the phone and call 911. So I 
think the I could pick up the phone. Nine one 
dispatch. The. Police to come to my apartment. 
They're much more apt to. Get that intrader that was 
in my apartment. 

In multifamily. I'm not really. I'm not impressed. 
The Security systems. I don't because Cron crime can 
happen anywhere. So I really don't know what 
additional pieces from a security aspect could be 
used other than some additional doors, sensors, if 
necessary. So sorry. 


No, that was super helpful. Thank you so much. 


You're welcome. 


Thank you again for taking the time to chat with us. 
We really appreciate the time that you took and we 
will let you get back with. Your busy day. 


Thank you. I'll solve some problems. 


Yeah, I'm sure you will. And then more will pop up. 


Thank you guys. 


All right. See ya. Bye.
 
Abbey interview
Thank you. Great. So to start, tell me about what a 
typical work week looks like for you. 


Yeah, so I'm the residential experience Manager, so 
I oversee right now we have six properties in my 
portfolio, so figuring out how to get new residents 
into the buildings, figuring out once we get them 
in, how to retain them, and then also figuring out 
what new res would want at new properties that we're 
developing. So a little bit of doing some research 
to figure out what new renters are looking for as 
far as amenities and features and things like that. 


How do you decide what you proceed with after that 
research? 


So basically we look first at the demographics of, 
okay, this is what the area is needing. This is the 
age group we're probably going to try to target. 
Then we look at budgeting for the building, what we 
have to work with, what our marketing strategy is 
going to be for that target audience, and then we 
start evaluating once we pick this is an amenity. 
Let's figure out then what other buildings in the 
area have it, how we're going to sell it, and then 
also evaluating different products. 


Great. And when you say we, who is the we in that? 


So that would be me as well as people on our 
marketing team, our development team, and then our 
construction team. 


Great. What would you say the most rewarding part of 
your job is? 


I also get to help a lot with resident events. So I 
really like that because it's a great time to 
interact one on one with the resident and then get 
that direct feedback. We do a lot of social surveys 
that we send out to get their feedback, but it's 
different when it's one on one and you can talk to 
people face to face. So that I'd say is most 
rewarding. 


What would you say is most challenging? 


The most challenging is definitely like, resident 
frustrations and conflict. So if something's ever 
wrong in their apartment or security breaches, 
things like that, that's probably the biggest 
headache. 


Who are you communicating with most frequently at 
work? 


At work, typically I work a lot with our marketing 
team as well as our operations team is who I work 
with the most. 


And how are you typically communicating with 
residents today? Sorry, 


residents? We use 


email. 


Sorry? We use email a lot. And then we also use a 
platform called Active Building. So that's a way 
that they can put in work orders, pay their rent and 
things like that. 


Tell me about the tools that you use on a regular 
basis. 


So right now we have like a leasing CRM. We use lead 
to lease and then knock. We use Real Page, and then 
we use Active Building as well. At some of our 
properties we have IoTis, and then some of our 
properties we have a product called Stratus. 


Tell me about Stratus. 


So Stratus, we actually just launched at one of our 
first properties. So I don't know a ton about it yet 
or have a lot of one on one experience with it, but 
we use it for keys and locks as well as our smart 
home technology with the Amazon Alexa. 


How did you decide to move forward with Stratus? 


So deciding on Stratus was kind of a variety of 
things at the time. When we were looking, I believe 
I, Otis, did not have the integration with keys with 
the key system anyways that we were going to be 
using. We did want to integrate with Butterfly for 
our locks on our apartment doors as well as our 
Amenity doors. 


And so you listed a bunch of tools. I'm curious how 
you manage all of those. 


Yes. So right now it's kind of tricky because they 
all get managed separately. Right. Everything has 
its own app, its own website. So lately, another 
part of my job has been looking into various 
softwares and trying to get everything has a 
different feature, trying to find something that has 
the most features integrated into one. Just from a 
resident experience side of things, we don't want 
them to have to have ten different apps that they 
need to log into. 


How has that search been going? Have you found 
anything valuable? 


So it hasn't been great, if I'm being honest. I 
found one product that I'm looking at. It's called 
Elevated Living, and that is integrated with package 
concierge and a lot of those different products. But 
with budget season being over and now getting ready 
for the next budget season, we have the whole next 
year to evaluate changes. 


When you're making those evaluations of which tools 
make sense for you and which maybe wouldn't fit for 
your property, what are the different dimensions 
that you're considering? 


Yeah, so typically for each product, we'll make a 
pros and cons list and then break it down by feature 
that each product offers. So we'll do like side by 
side comparisons. Then after we do that, typically, 
I will introduce it to other people right. Pass that 
comparison along, and then the different departments 
or whoever needs to be involved on the 


decision 


would go through and 


rank 


each item one through five or whatever we make the 
ranking be so that then in total, we can tally to 
figure out which product overall has the highest 
score. 


That is a beautiful system. I'm curious if anything 
ever trumps the number, ultimately, are there other 
factors or is it most like if you get the highest 
rating, that is the one you go with? 


So it depends. Obviously, there's some pretty key 
things, right, depending on what it is, because each 
issue also is a little bit different, where if, say, 
one might score higher overall, but then it's 
consistently in our top three important categories, 
then we might go with the other one that just 
happens to rank higher in those categories versus 
overall. 


Great. And then earlier you were talking about that 
resident experience and some of the value you have 
in having those one on one interactions and then the 
challenges you experience with some friction with 
residents at times. Curious what, if anything, have 
you tried to mitigate some of those challenges? 


So typically we try to get as much feedback from 
residents as possible after they have a work order, 
after they move in, renew any of those things. We 
have automatic social surveys that come out also 
every year we do capital expense upgrades where 
we'll walk the property, figure out what needs 
fixing. And typically, if we're kind of at a 
standstill where we can't decide, we'll send out a 
survey to the residents to get their feedback and 
give them a little bit of power of that deciding 
factor of what they want to see in their building. 


Great. How would you say technology makes your job 
easier, if at all? 


So technology with automation, as long as it works, 
definitely makes our job a lot easier. So kind of 
how I just said with those surveys, that is huge. 
And then we get that feedback, which is super 
important to us as well as with smart home 
technology. Having the capability to say the season 
is changing, we need to turn the heat off and turn 
the air on or whatever it might be. Having the 
capability to on all vacants on a dashboard, just 
switch it from heat to air or turn the lights off, 
things like that. Just saves our maintenance team 
and our onsite team a lot of time. 


Yeah, let's talk about IoTis now. So I'm curious, in 
your own words, what does Iotas do for you and your 
properties? 


Yeah, so at the properties that we have it set up, 
we have the Smart home features where it's connected 
to Alexa for light and temperature. It's a huge 
selling factor on our sales route in our tours, we 
have it set up in our models and it's something that 
residents really see a value add on in. A lot of 
people are more environmentally conscious these days 
and being able to make sure that certain times of 
the day these lights are off or if you forget it, 
you don't have to be stressed, worry about your 
electric bill. All of those things are huge selling 
factors. And I mean, me personally, that's something 
I really enjoy about the Smart Home products. 


You mentioned earlier that when you're deciding 
which technology makes sense for a different 
property, you're ranking all of those demographic 
factors as well. For IoTis, who do you think the 
right resident is for IoTis? Demographics. 


So the buildings that we, and when I say we are 
marketing teams, done extensive research and 
development team have typically a little bit younger 
demographics of people that are right out of 
college, their first job is mostly the buildings 
that we have it at. So typically, age wise, 
demographic is going to be 25 to 35 is where we're 
seeing the most usage as well with those products. 


What has usage been like? 


So usage has been pretty high when it comes to 
certain things. So with thermostat and lights, it's 
been very high. At some of our properties. We did a 
poll, actually, because we were trying to figure out 
for a new product project if smart outlets were 
being used, and those weren't. It was mostly 
overhead light being used, as well as temperature 
being used. 


Overall, how would you say the resident reaction to 
Iota's products have been? 


It's been pretty high. The only issue really that 
we've had is with the smart outlets, they just 
continuously be clicking. If one would go out, it 
would not blow a fuse, but it would trigger all the 
other outlets to go off. But I don't necessarily 
know that that's an IoTis issue. I think that's more 
a smart outlet issue. So overall, it's been pretty 
easy from a resident experience to set up. We give 
them the instructions, this is what you do, and it's 
been pretty easy. 


What about for the staff that are on site? How has 
Iota been for them? 


Iota has been pretty good. We did run into some 
issues at one of our properties with I'm trying to 
think of the word, it's like set up, but you have to 
basically take this device and go do all these 
different things. So at one of our buildings, when 
we took it over, it was all set up for us, so we 
didn't have to do that. We're at another building 
because of construction delays, we ended up doing it 
as a team and then there were more headaches. So it 
just, I guess, varying feedback depending on which 
situation we were in. 


That makes a lot of sense. So really that set up 
process itself is hard. But then once it was set up, 
how was it after that? 


Then? After that we didn't have any issues. It's 
super simple to add residents in and to remove 
residents on the Iota dashboard and been super easy 
for us, as well as getting those alerts if a 
temperature is too high or too low. That's been very 
helpful as well. 


Yeah. Overall, what would you say the value Iota 
springs? What is the value that Iota springs to 
property staff? 


Yeah, I mean, the value is huge, I think, because 
even those time saving measures, like I said 
earlier, of vacant units being able to just from a 
dashboard control, all of that is huge. It's a huge 
time saver. 


What do you wish was different about Iota? 


Good question. I don't know. I wouldn't change a lot 
about it. I think the app is super intuitive. The 
only thing is, and maybe this isn't an Iota thing, 
it's other software just having everything 
integrated and centralized on one app. So just the 
more times we could integrate it with our resident 
active building, residents use or whatever platform 
we use for resident engagement. Would be nice to 
have it all in one. 


Is the same true on the property staff side or does 
that feel different? 


Overall? It's not a huge deal for us to have a 
different login and log into something, but anytime 
we can make any step even a little bit shorter or 
faster is definitely worth it. That would be my only 
feedback. 


If it was to integrate with Active building, what 
would that be like for you? What would the resident 
experience then be? 


It would just be more seamless. So we could say 
download this one app versus download these two 
apps. And then I think it would also boost 
engagement just on both ends and both platforms. 
Because if they're constantly going into IoTis, oh, 
they'll see Active Building. Oh, I need to reserve 
an amenity that triggered my thought versus when 
you're going into two different ones. You might even 
be forgetting if you're always in Active Building 
that you even have those functionalities. And I Otis 
because you're not physically clicking on that app. 


Yeah. So really making sure the resident is aware of 
what they have and remind them of what the amenities 
are that are available to them. 


Yeah, absolutely. 


Makes total sense when a new resident joins, how is 
it all do you onboard them to Iota? 


So typically we will send them a little instruction 
file of this is how you connect it to your Amazon 
Alexa. Currently we do give Amazon Alexis as a move 
in gift so that no matter what, they're still able 
to utilize all of the functions. So just giving them 
those directions. Overall, our residents at the 
buildings have been pretty tech savvy and we haven't 
run into a lot of issues. If they do continue to 
experience issues, we do, I believe, still give them 
the Iota support line and they're able to reach out 
directly there. 


What types of issues that come up are ones that make 
sense for Iota support to handle versus you all to 
work with the resident on? 


So sometimes for us, they will maybe have typed 
maybe on our end, we'll have typed in the wrong 
email address for what to be sent to them and then 
they'll be like, I didn't receive the registration 
link. And then that's issues that we will handle 
versus sometimes it'll be larger issues where their 
phone is constantly not connecting or it's just not 
working, where then we ask them to escalate to 
support. 


How much work would you say having IoTis has added 
to your plate? 


I wouldn't really say any just because the only work 
that our onsite team has to do is send them the 
email registration with their name, email and unit 
number. So that's just something added on our 
checklist that we do before moving. So it doesn't 
really add much time. 


How much time would you say it saved? 


I would say it saves probably 30 minutes a week just 
because we're not constantly having to check 
thermostats and things like that. It depends how 
many vacants or if it's a lease up, things like 
that. It can save a substantial amount of time. 


Let's say, hypothetically, we wanted to increase it 
from 30 minutes a week to saving an hour a week. 
What could be incorporated into the product to help 
save more time? From a property staff perspective, 


I would say, and maybe I don't know if this is an 
Iota set up or in our property set up, but even 
amenities, being able to hook it up to more things, 
right? So maybe being able to control our fireplaces 
okay, let me turn on the lobby fireplace. Let me 
turn on check the pool heat in the spa or check the 
hot tub heat or whatever. If it was connected to 
more things in our amenities, I think that would 
save us time just because daily we're doing property 
walks, obviously. But if we could just make sure 
those things are consistent right, from a single 
dashboard, it would save walking time. 


Great. Then earlier you mentioned Stratus. How did 
Iotas compare to stratus? 


Yeah, so we actually just did a training on it last 
week, so I haven't had a ton of experience with it. 
It's a little bit different because it works with 
paired with something called Bravo 


Locks 


or Bravo Locks, where then we can send virtual keys. 
And that's paired with butterfly, and it's just 
paired with a lot of different things. I can't 
remember if I otis has those same capabilities or 
not, but that was something that, so far, we have 
really liked about Stratus. 


When you were making that decision to go with 
Stratus, did you look into Iota? Like, whether IoTis 
would have met those needs or not? Or was it more we 
want this, so we found this company that does it. 


Yes. So basically, one of our developers lived in a 
building that used Stratus. So that was also a heavy 
decision maker of him personally using it every 
single day. From the resident experience side of 
things, 


what about that? Resident experience works really 
well for Stratus. 


Just where it's kind of seamless, it's couch to sofa 
is kind of what we're marketing it as, that you can 
send keys, you can let your door dash in. You can 
send a virtual dog walker, a key, all of that in one 
app. Another thing, too, that I believe was a 
factor, was IoTis has a modem in every apartment 
versus Stratus. You can have multiple apartments on 
a modem, so they're actually located in the 
hallways. We did run into some issues where 
residents were taking our Iota 


modem 


and then either they'd have to give it back or we'd 
have to charge them. Where with stratus? Having it 
in the hallways has helped because residents aren't 
seeing it thinking when they move out, they can take 
it and 


then 


hopefully it will save us money in the long run. 


That makes a lot of sense. Are there any other 
quirks like that where, like, the residents taking 
those modems or anything else quirky with Iota that 
comes up? 


Nothing else really? I'm sure as I keep talking, 
maybe something will pop in my head like that just 
did, but not that I can think of. 


Totally fair. And so thinking about that resident 
usage, how, if at all, are you encouraging residents 
to use Iota today? 


So we do encourage them. Say they have a complaint 
about their utility bill seeming higher. We bring 
that up as a talking point. Hey, remember, you do 
have this app where when you're not home, you can 
set stories where certain times of the day lights 
will go on and off or whatever. We remind them of 
those things and then typically that actually helps. 
And then the next month they'll see a reduction in 
their utility billing. So we use that as like a 
talking sales point. 


How is that all? Could I notice help you encourage 
resident usage? 


I would say so. Right now. I know that we have like 
step by step instructions, but maybe if there were 
like and maybe there is and I just haven't seen it 
yet, like video clips demonstrating short little 
52nd ones or like a TikTok showing you these are 
little things that are selling points that then we 
could add to our social media as well. Just for 
marketing to new residents, current residents as 
well. 


That makes a lot of sense. What do you think the 
biggest barrier is for residents using biodivers 
products available to them? 


Yeah, so, I mean, some people, I feel, aren't big 
into smart home technology in general. So I think 
sometimes we at those buildings do have some people 
that are a little bit older clientele and they just 
in general, they never grew up with it, so they 
aren't really used to it and don't use it. So that's 
probably the biggest barrier. Reason why some people 
don't use it. 


Makes total sense. And kind of switching gears a 
little bit and thinking about data. What information 
do you receive from Iota about your residence or 
your properties that you find valuable? 


Yeah, so, I mean, we find super valuable when we 
figure out, okay, how often are they using these 
certain products just so we can do an evaluation of 
is it worth it to put it into our new development? 
So figuring out how often they're using it for 
outlets versus lights versus temperature, all of 
that just helps us gauge the value in 


it. What information would be helpful to have for 
myotus that you don't have today on your residence 
or your properties? 


I would say maybe just a little bit more analytics 
into if there's certain and again, maybe this 
already is a thing, but into certain unit sizes. 
Hey, we're noticing our alcoves and studios use it 
all the time our two bedrooms aren't using it just 
more analytics into those specifics I think could be 
helpful. 


What types of decisions do you want to be making 
based on data that Iota can provide to you? 


A decision that we have made in the past is we've 
kind of forgone the smart outlets just because we 
were seeing they weren't being used. And that was an 
added value spend that we were paying for for each 
outlet in the apartments where we could save on that 
and then continue to have different have it in our 
lights and temperature. Something that I would like 
to see is dimmable lights. I don't know, is that 
something I don't think that we're able to do on 
there of, okay, I want to dim the lights versus turn 
it on. Turn it off. That's a feature that we're 
starting to use a lot in our living rooms and 
bedrooms just for watching TV at night or if you're 
hosting a party and wanting the lights a little bit 
lower, that's something cool that could be added if 
it hasn't been already. 


Yeah believe the dimmable lights is actually 
something that is available at the end. We can go 
over some of those things. Well, I'll have someone 
else go over it because I'm not the expert, but that 
is one as well as the locks that you're talking 
about earlier. But putting that to the side for a 
moment, that's a great point. I'm curious with the 
smart outlets, I think earlier you had mentioned 
that it was a survey that helped you figure that out 
about the smart outlets. 


Is 


that right? What information, if any, are you 
getting from those surveys that potentially maybe 
it'd be easier to not have to ask residents 
directly, but IoTis could provide to you or anyone 
could provide to you. Are there things you're going 
back to them about? 


I mean, things like that would be helpful. I haven't 
played around a lot on the analytics side of things 
just because it's been a while since I've been on 
site and needing to be in the dashboard and things 
like that. But yeah, anytime when we don't need to 
survey residents ourselves and can just pull actual 
data facts, that's always helpful. 


Yeah. What are some of the other things that you're 
surveying residents about today? 


So we survey them, asking what type of resident 
events they'd like to see, what type of amenities 
and things like that. We ask them a lot. 


You mentioned you're not on site that much today. As 
someone who is off site, what information, if any, 
would be valuable for you to have about your 
properties as someone off site? 


So, I mean, definitely usage. Also ratings. If there 
is a way where residents can even just five star how 
was set up, how is using it on the daily, how often 
are you using it? Any type of surveys like that 
would be very helpful for me to figure out from a 
resident experience side of things how they're 
enjoying those products. 


Yeah, great. And then as you may know, iotus is 
recently acquired by ADT. So I'm curious, what do 
you think about IoTis becoming ADT? 


So, I don't know a lot about it, but I know that our 
team down in Colorado has started to work with the 
new company a little bit, just with still 
programming some of the units and getting those set 
up. And so far what I've heard from them is that 
their experience has been pretty good so far. 


What benefits do you see in Iota's becoming ADT, if 
any? 


I don't know enough about it to I feel like answer 
that one 


totally fair. At a higher level, what role do you 
see security playing in smart homes, if any? 


I see a lot, definitely just because integration 
with the doors is huge. Being able to see, okay, 
this person entered my apartment, this person 
entered this amenity at that time is huge. Security 
has been a big issue for most properties all over 
the country lately. So just any extra analytics and 
insight into that I think is really important. 


Great. So it sounds like mostly around that 
integration with the doors and having more insight 
into who's moving in and out of the property. 


Yes, absolutely. What 


about on the property staff side, if anything? 


So, I mean it would be nice to have that integrated. 
Even with our office doors, the amount of times 
people lose their office keys and we have to re key 
is a lot. So having a virtual key or being able to 
just unlock it from your phone would save a lot of 
headache. 


When you think about the people on site, if you 
could solve their top three pains, what would their 
top three pains be for the people on site? 


I would say programming keys, security breaches like 
in the garage or issues like that are huge. I'm 
trying to think fraudulent applications is a huge 
thing. I know that's not necessarily something 
probably Iota could help with, but that's a big 
headache and then just being short staffed. So 
anything that saves us time would help the onsite 
team. 


What about as someone off site, what are the top 
three things that are most challenging for you? 


So I would say even short staffing to being off 
site. Anything that getting those analytics and 
things where we're not necessarily having to ask the 
onsite teams hey, can you give me information or 
what are you hearing? Obviously those are good 
conversations to have, but sometimes if we can give 
the onsite teams more time back, that's going to be 
helpful. 

And then also just for research and development 
analytics, that will also save time as well. 


What is the process like today for getting those 
analytics? 


So right now we'll do market surveys where I'll have 
to call the different properties. That would be our 
competition set calling them asking them, what 
products are you using? What features are you using? 
If we could even have a list of these, are the 
properties near you that have this same software 
system, that would be helpful and save me some time. 


Is it mostly around the information you're looking 
for? Is it mostly around what others are doing in 
the area? 


Yes. So we try to match what they're doing, but then 
we try to elevate it to the next level, too. So 
figuring out, okay, this is what they have, this is 
where we could take it to the next level. 


When you make that decision of, okay, we have IoTis. 
Now, what goes into the decision to keep IoTis over 
time? 


Yeah. So I know that we've just had a really great 
relationship with IoTis and the people at IoTis, so 
that obviously plays a huge part in it. Also, the 
support team has been huge, being able to support us 
as well as our residents. There's nothing worse, I 
feel like, than picking a company and they take a 
week to respond to you. And that's not been the case 
for us, so that's been a reason why we've stuck with 
Iota. 


Great. And what, if anything, would make you leave? 


I mean, if that were to change, if all of a sudden 
we used to be getting responses, we're not anymore, 
or if we're all of a sudden having a lot more 
issues, technically, I think that would make us 
reconsider. 


Totally fair. Well, great. Thank you for letting me 
pepper you with a million questions. Now we're going 
to switch gears a little bit and do an activity 
together. We're actually going to do two activities 
because it's an exciting afternoon. So our first 
activity, I'm going to share my screen, what I have 
here, and I'll zoom in. I want to give you the lay 
of the land. So what I have is a pyramid and a list 
of needs that we think you may or may not experience 
in your day to day work. And what we want to 
understand is what you need the most and what you 
could live without. So I'm going to have you sort 
these from the top of what you need the most to the 
bottom of what you could live without. I also have 
an option for you to add one if there's something 
that we're missing. So looking at this list tier we 
have, make the tasks I complete on a daily basis 
easier to do. Help us identify optimizations to save 
money and increase efficiency. Ensure residents feel 
safe and protected. Ensure myself and other property 
staff feel safe and protected. Help us make our 
buildings feel like a community. Make communicating 
with my team and with residents easier. Help us 
attract new residents and help us retain existing 
residents. When you think about the high level needs 
that you experience, what are we missing here? What 
should we add? 


I mean, those are. All really good. I would say do 
you want me to start organizing them or you just 
more want me to talk about the blank one to figure 
out 


what we can start organizing? Unless you have one 
that you're thinking of for the blank one, 


let's start organizing and then maybe while I'm 
doing that, I'll think of something 


perfect. What would you put up top? 


Most important I would say is ensure residents feel 
safe and protected. 


Why that one up there? 


Just because I think if they feel safe and 
protected, they're going to renew easier and overall 
they're going to have a better experience. 


Great. 


And then number two under that for each one would be 
help us attract new residents and help us retain 
existing residents. 


Is that in order of priority? Like, would you say 
attracting is more important than retaining? 


No, I would say retaining is more important than 
attracting. 


Why is that? 


Well, just because typically longevity is always 
good. It's less money on turns. It's also less money 
on new ad spend for advertising. I'm 


going to move these down with us as we go. Okay. 
What would come next? 


No worries. Let's see. Next I would put make 
communicating with my team and residents easier 
would be next. How 


are you handling that one today? 


So, I mean, right now we're communicating a lot 
through active building and then also like a 
property shared email address. Not that that's not 
easy, but the threads aren't always in the same area 
and spot. So that's also, I guess if we're asking 
pain points is just also having communications be in 
the same spot. Whether that be text, email, phone 
call, if there was a way to have everything shown in 
almost like a text thread where you could click 
listen to the phone call or see the text, see the 
email, all in one spot would be helpful. 


Is that for both residents in your team or one or 
the other? 


It would be for both. Okay, 


great. 


Next I would say ensure myself and other property 
staff are safe and protected. Tell 


me more about your thoughts on that one. 


So I mean, for the most part, our staff and property 
feel safe and protected on site. I just don't think 
you can ever go wrong with a little added security 
feeling 


I get that perfect. 


And then next I would put make the tasks I complete 
on a daily basis easier to do. 


That one. We have relatively low in this pyramid. 
Tell me about that. 


So right now with Iota and smart home technology, 
it's already saving us a good amount of time. Yes, 
it could be saving us more, but I would say that 
it's already been saving us a lot of time. So it 
already feels pretty good in my mind. 


Great. And then last two here, which would come 
first? 


Help us identify optimizations and save money and 
increase efficiency. Why 


are these ones at the bottom. 


I mean, it's hard because those are still very 
important. Right. I think I'm probably biased 
because in my role, it's mostly resident experience. 
So thinking about the residents, thinking about our 
onsite members, not necessarily budgets and money, 
things like that. So I think that's why those are a 
little bit lower. Making our buildings feel like a 
community, I feel like that is very important. We 
want the building to feel like a community. I 
haven't figured out a way to kind of pair smart home 
technology and that together as far as like, 
resident fence and things like that go, 


if that was possible. Is that worth exploring? 


I mean, it's definitely something that we would want 
to explore, yes. 


When you think about what does make a building feel 
like a community, what comes to mind for you? 


For me, I would say it's having a good community 
virtually, socially. So we'll do sometimes virtual 
events, door decorating contests, things like that. 
And people posting, hey, I'm selling this couch. 
Anybody want it? Does anyone have this? I ran out of 
this. People will post that on our active building 
wall. It's kind of like a Facebook page. And that 
builds community as well as any type of event. We do 
build community. 


Great. And then we've left our sticky note. Anything 
else come to mind for you that we've missed in terms 
of what you need? I 


don't think so, because we kind of have everything 
covered. Where new residents, current residents, 
property staff, I mean, kind of maybe what we talked 
about earlier with corporate staff needs of 
providing more analytics to save corporate and 
onsite team member staff or time. 


Where would you put that one? 


I mean, I would put that down next to the other 
ones, just on the right hand side. 


All right, any changes? This is your last 
opportunity to change your prioritization. 
Everything feel good? 


I feel good with it. 


All right, we're locking it in. Great. Thank you for 
going through that. Now we're going to get a little 
bit more specific in terms of features and 
functionality, and we're going to do another 
prioritization exercise. This time, what we're going 
to do is sort different features into one of three 
categories. First, being candy. Candy brings 
temporary joy, but in the long run does not have 
meaningful benefits. Vitamins will make things 
better, but it's not essential painkillers solve for 
a painful problem. So those are your three options, 
and we'll go through these one by one. So the first 
one is residents receive proactive notifications 
with recommendations based on their behavior. For 
example, on average, three lights remain on without 
any motion from 08:30 A.m. To 04:00 P.m.. Create an 
out for the day routine. Would you say that's a 
candy, a vitamin, or a painkiller make it better 
too? 


I would say that's probably a candy. Can I move 
these later once we start? 


Yes, 100%. 


Okay, 


we can start there. What's your thought process 
behind a candy for that one, 


just because the three lights remain on, if it's in 
the next morning, they've already been on. So it 
didn't necessarily fix the problem. If it was 
something where it said, hey, we detected this, we 
turned the light off, maybe that would be different. 


Yeah. So it's less helpful to observe behavior. It's 
more helpful to proactively take action on something 
that could be causing an issue. 


Yeah, 


that makes total sense. Great. So next one is your 
team enjoys using the dashboard because the 
experience is easy to use and beautiful. That be a 
candy, a vitamin, or a painkiller. 


I would say that's a painkiller. 


Why is that? 


Just because. If it's easy to use. If things are 
hard to use, that's a headache and you need a 
migraine pillar. 


Great. What about this one? Residents are able to 
monitor energy and water usage for their unit and 
receive notifications about usage. 


I'm going to put that as a vitamin. 


Why a vitamins? 


Just because. Again, that information is super 
helpful. If there was maybe an added thing in there 
with a suggestion of, hey, this is your usage for 
the month, here's a suggestion, tip of how to lower 
your utility bill. If that was added in there, I 
would say that's a painkiller. But without, again, 
that actionable item, I put it as a vitamin. 


Great. Then this next one is residents can shop for 
and add new devices pre approved by your team. 


I'd say that's a candy. What 


makes it a candy? 


Just because. I don't think in the long run how 
often are they actually using that function is 
probably not super often, but it is candy. 


Yeah. So it's more like a moment in time. In that 
moment in time, is there value? 


I think there is value, yes. In that moment of time. 
I just don't see it as a recurring thing that 
they're constantly going to be using. 


Makes total sense. And next one? Residents have 
enhanced routine options like weather driven 
routines or ones based on who is home. 


I would say vitamin. Just because our residents 
don't use that function super often. But I know that 
it's not essential, but it's something that they 
like to use or like to have the option to have. 


Tell me more about that. I'm not using it right now. 


I'm trying to figure out how to elaborate on it. We 
just haven't had a ton of people setting up the 
stories and things like that. So that's kind of the 
reason why my answer 


that makes total sense. How are you finding out that 
they're not setting them up from data from self? Is 
it something you're checking in on or is it 
something that they're telling you about? 


That is something that was also on our survey when 
we sent it out about the different usages. 


Was that survey specifically on smart home 
functionality? 


It was. 


Is there any chance you can absolutely say no, but 
would you be willing to share not the data, but, 
like, the survey itself, just so we can see what 
types of questions you're asking? 


Yeah, absolutely. I could can I just email it to you 
after 


this? 


I can. That 


would be awesome. 


Okay, yeah, no problem. 


Thank you so much. It's just helpful to get a sense 
for what are the type of information you're asking 
for because potentially we could build that into the 
experience later 


too. Yeah, absolutely. 


Okay, back to candy, vitamins, and painkillers. 
Residents can set up other home utilities through 
their Iota app. So like electric or their Internet 
provider. 


I'd say that's a painkiller because that gives them 
back time, having everything set up in one spot. 


Great. Your team has access to industry wide and 
market wide data related to multifamily homes. 


I'd say that's a painkiller. Yeah, just because, 
again, that's saving us time, having that data right 
there. 


If you had that type of data, is that something 
where you wouldn't need to be doing the comparative 
cost that you've been doing? Would it replace that 
for you, or are there other things that you'd want 
to replace? 


Yeah, I mean, that would replace that for us by a 
long shot. Yeah. 


Great. And then property staff can communicate with 
residents and other team members via an app. 


I would say that's either going to be a vitamin or a 
painkiller. The only reason is because we already 
have an app that we kind of use. It would depend 
what the set up would look like and comparing what 
that looks like versus what we already have in place 


to make 


that 


what would need to be true about the experience. 


So, I mean, if there was a way kind of how I 
described earlier, where text, phone calls, emails 
were all visually available in the same exact spot 
for all the team members to see, then I would put it 
as a painkiller. 


All right, so 


we can put it as a painkiller. 


Okay. It sounds like you have something today, but 
if it was able to actually solve for what your 
current system is not solving for, then it would be 
a painkiller for 


you. Yeah. 


Great. All right. Residents enjoy using the app 
because the experience is easy to use and beautiful. 


I would say that's also painkiller because we put it 
for our team. Same with the residents. 


And then your team has access to property specific 
data insights that help determine your property 
health. 


Wait, because the other one was about other 
properties in the area, 


correct? 


Yes. Then that would be a painkiller as well. 


And I know we talked about this a little bit, but 
are there specific data insights that would be more 
valuable for you in terms of property health? 


I think just figuring out overall usage, figuring 
out how often people are actually utilizing it. 


Great. And then last one here, your team can receive 
event based alerts, for example, a water leak or a 
break in. 


Oh, I mean, that's for sure. Pain counter, because 
that's just going to save our maintenance team and 
our residents headaches. 


Great. And then those are all the ones that we had 
for you. As we were sorting that, did any ideas come 
to mind that you think would be particularly 
valuable or interesting to consider in terms of 
feature function? 


I mean, definitely the break ins, water leaks, all 
of that. That's super helpful. Any of those sensors 
or technology pieces. 


Great. All right. Thank you so much for going 
through that. I'm going to stop sharing my screen, 
and I'm going to pause for a moment and see if any 
of our observers on the line want to ask any 
questions or provide additional information. As 
well. The information I was not able to provide 
earlier. Feel free to come off mute. 


Hi, Abby. I have a quick question for you. Thanks so 
much. It's been super interesting. You mentioned a 
few times about the survey that you do, and I think 
you said you did it once a year. Is there a reason 
you do that once a year? 


So we actually did it. It was not once a year. That 
was just a one time survey that we did when we were 
evaluating smart home technologies, that we not 
necessarily companies, but just different 
functionalities that we wanted in our new build. 


Got it. Do you see yourself going forward doing this 
again on a regular cadence? 


Yeah, I mean, I think now that you kind of brought 
up the once a year as we get new residents in the 
lifecycle of a resident, I do think it would be 
something helpful to conduct once a year to get that 
feedback. 


And what is the kind of workflow of doing that 
survey? How long does it take you to put together? 
How long does it take to collect who reviews it? 


It doesn't take super long to put together. It's 
actually through a real page product called Social 
Surveys, where we just type in the questions, and 
then we can either have it be true, false, yes, no, 
or ranking one to five. We did a ranking one to five 
just to kind of see how often people are using 
things. But it doesn't take us super long to put 
together, and then we review it. But not all 
residents respond to it, so maybe if they saw it 
come from My Otis, they might respond. 


Last question on this. You mentioned that one of the 
results of the survey is to let you know which 
resources residents are liking so that you can 
potentially reinvest in them. If I can play it back 
to you like that, what's your budget cycle in terms 
of expenses? Is it like a yearly thing that you have 
the ability to upgrade the property, or is it just 
as demand arises? 


So it depends. Obviously, if it's an emergency, we 
can override the budget, but typically we put our 
budgets together at the very end of the year, and 
then it starts like quarter one, quarter two, 
quarter three, quarter four, and we budget a certain 
amount for each quarter, but we have our overall 
budget for the whole year. 


Thanks. That's super helpful. Thank you so much. 


No problem. 


Looking for any other unmute now or forever hold 
your peace. Okay, great. So two last questions just 
to wrap up. So we sorted all those feature functions 
into candy, vitamin, painkiller. Last one, last 
sorting. If you had to put IoTis in a category of 
candy, vitamin, or painkiller today, what category 
would you put it in? I 


would put it as a painkiller just because it does 
save our team a lot of time, as well as it is 
something that our residents really like from a 
standpoint of it being easy for our residents and 
onsite team to use. And then also environmentally, 
our company has a huge ESG standpoint, so whenever 
we can be eco friendly, we try to be 


great. And then last question for you. As we 
continue trying to improve the Iota's ADT experience 
over time, you have to leave us with one piece of 
advice. What would you leave us with? 


I would say, I don't know. Do you guys do, like, 
check ins with the Onsite team? Like, if you send 
them follow ups, maybe every quarter. Hey, how's it 
going? Even maybe asking us to rate you guys every 
quarter, I think feedback is always good and useful, 
and so maybe even just the onsite teams from a site 
level who's dealing with it every day, that might be 
helpful. 


That is great advice. I see a hand that came up. 


Yeah, I did have a question on that ESG one, Abby, 
because if I remember correctly, sherman Associates 
had a whole solar farm. Right? And I 


kind of got 


curious on that one, what you guys are doing with it 
and whether or not energy monitoring, reporting of 
that nature is important or not. Because you have a 
whole solar farm, 


it is still really important. So, Sherman 
Associates, we have a large portfolio of market rate 
apartments, but we have an even larger portfolio of 
affordable housing. So those solar gardens actually 
go towards reducing a large chunk of affordable 
housing's, utility billing. So a lot of those 
properties actually don't pay very much at all for 
utilities because we get a credit on having those 
solar gardens. So in that sense, for the affordable 
housing, they're benefiting from that hugely, 
whereas our market rate apartments, they're not 
seeing really, like, credits and things like that 
from the solar gardens. So for them to still be able 
to monitor and control and reduce their usage on 
those bills is still huge from an environmental side 
of things. 


Thank you. That was super helpful. 


Yeah, no problem. 


Thank you so, so much. This has been incredibly 
helpful. And we just really, again, appreciate you 
taking time out of your busy day to talk to us and 
share your feedback. It's really important and 
invaluable. So thank you so much. I hope you have a 
great rest of your 


day. 


You 


too. 


Have a good one. 


You too. Bye, everybody. 


Bye.
 
Todd interview
And I assume there's no typical by that 


laugh. Right. Yeah, no. Right. It's a Property 
management. Of its finest. Every day. Brings some of 
the same but very much difference to the case. So as 
a property manager for me, I spend. A lot of time in 
budgets and reporting. And. Not necessarily as much 
supervising as I would like to be doing. I spend 
more of my time looking at things from a 200 foot 
level. Versus. Getting two ingrained and daytoday 
kind of things that are going on in our property. I 
do have a community manager that supervises the 
staff and kind of works through some of the daytoday 
operations, but I still do get involved in a lot of 
them. Any variety of. Resident issues that come up 
that get brought to my attention. Issues. We have a 
lot of third party vendors that we work with from a 
leasing standpoint. So I kind of manage all of those 
relationships and work directly with. Any of our 
contacts I could do with I o this ad. I've got that 
same kind of interaction with three or four other 
companies that we work with. Yeah. You know, it's 
one of those things, right? Like, I wish there was 
an easy answer for this is what 


my. 


This is when I clock in and when I clock out, but 
that doesn't. That doesn't always work. 


Yeah. That's that's not your lot, 


unfortunately. 


Yeah. Well, I'm I'm curious. Which, if any of those 
things, or any kind of key responsibilities that you 
have, which do you kind of wish were not on your 
plate. 


You know, honestly, I'm happy that they all are 
because it really lets me focus on what's happening 
in our community. And it gives me all the data and 
all the details that I need. For when I meet with 
ownership or I meet with other. My supervisor. I 
meet with other partners along the way. I mean. Our 
property is really kind of different in terms of my 
ownership group as a subsidiary of hunts, but I 
report into a different area. So I spent a lot of 
time working with a lot of people from all over the 
country. On a lot of our day to day or monthly 
operations. 


Okay. Well. In terms of kind of. All the different 
aspects of your job, which would you say, is kind of 
like the fine, the one you find the most rewarding. 


A positive net operating income for our ownership 
group. I mean, really, we're. A truly conventional 
property that is tasked to make money. And when we 
do, that makes me feel good. 


Yeah. What would you say is the most challenging 
part of the job. 


Stupid people. 


That's probably the answer I feel like for most 
jobs, but I'm curious how that looks like for you as 
a property manager, 


I think how it looks, how it looks for me is. And 
I'll preface this by saying that, you know, not all 
renters are good renters. So we run into a lot of 
issues. Unfortunately, more issues than I think 
anybody would care to deal with on people who don't 
take care of our property. People who don't pay the 
rent on time. People who think that they. Are own 
what they are renting and we run into a lot of. 
Negative. Complaints because of it because. People 
who pay rent to us or don't pay rent us don't 
understand. The terms of their lease and what 
they're responsible for, and what they're not 
responsible for. 


Yeah. And how do you typically kind of communicate 
with residents. 


I typically. Am in the last point of contact. If 
it's something that my staff. And this goes from a 
leasing perspective as well as a maintenance 
perspective. If it's something that none of my 
managers or other directors cannot resolve, and 
that's usually when I get involved. In. And try to 
help resolve whatever issues that we're running into 
or make a final decision on what needs to be done 
about somebody as to whether. They are. Need to move 
forward through an eviction process or. Be provided 
a 30 day notice to vacate or something like that. 


Gotcha do you feel like there's any. Common topics 
that you end up communicating with. Residents about. 


Common topics. It's usually the thing. That they 
find most aggravating about living in our community, 
and that is a lack of parking. We live. We are in a 
cold climate. So I know where you're at, but in 
Western South Dakota, where I'm at, it's really cold 
and snowy. And we have policies and procedures for 
where you park when these things happen. And if you 
don't, your vehicle gets towed and people don't like 
that. And you know, it's definitely. It always 
revolves around something. Some piece of information 
that's been provided to residents that they just 
don't understand or. Want to acknowledge. And adhere 
to. 


Gotcha I'm in Chicago, so I have definitely had that 
like, oh, no, I need to move my car moment when it. 


Gets a 


cold oh, yeah well and in terms of. Kind of like the 
building owner, operator management group. How do 
you typically communicate with them. 


So I actually have a weekly ownership call. Every 
Tuesday, so I'm in very. Positive and constant 
contact with our ownership group. To let them know 
of things that they need to be apprised or just keep 
them updated on what our weekly operations look 
like. 


All right. They're you know, aside from those two 
things, are they kind of common topics that you need 
to kind of touch base or communicate outside of that 
meeting with the building owner, operator. 


If there is they get a hold of me. You know, if they 
need something, they text and they get a hold of me 
too, so I can get them what they what they need 


gotcha. Okay. If you could, you know, take a magic 
wand and change one thing about your current job, 
your current responsibilities. What would you 
change. 


What's interesting. I wasn't prepared for all of 
these kind of openended questions about. My 
position. So forgive me if I. Don't actually have an 
answer to that off the top. I think one of the 
things that it would be nice to a lot of the things 
that I do manually right now. In terms of running 
reports. And. Going through data. Could all be 
automated, and it's not. Still very much physical. 
I'm running reports in the spreadsheets. And going 
through data and figuring things out where a lot of 
that could be automated. And it'd be nice. If that 
was the case, it would free up a lot of time for me. 


Yeah, well and again, like we're just wanting to 
hear your feedback. There's no right or wrong 
answers. So I appreciate, you know, I'm sure you are 
not expecting a magic one question today. Those 
don't always come up. 


No, no, I just. I thought this was gonna be an hour 
of talking about adt and iota. 


Well, we're getting there, but we want the context. 
Of you know, the things that you it sounds like you 
take on a lot and have a lot of balls, you know, and 
so having to kind of. Understand what that is gives 
us a lot more context about you know, then how you 
use the product, how it works for you. You 
mentioned. You know, there's a lot that you kind of 
have to you have to run reports, you have to look at 
spreadsheets. What tools do you currently use at 
work? We'd love to kind of know, like if it's Google 
Sheets or whatever kind of particular. Specific 
programs tools that you use for. All of those 
different pieces that you're doing. 


Sure. So we so. Rely very heavily on Word and excel 
right now. And I use them more out of Dropbox than I 
do out of Google sheets. But our company is starting 
to get into smart sheets a little bit more. Starting 
to get into a little bit more tableau. And. They're 
also making. Some changes into a lot of how we 
operate. Ideally, and building our own. Leasing 
model and maintenance model through salesforce. So 
that's kind of where. The trend is. But right now 
it's mostly. A variety of websites and communicating 
with my staff. And getting updates from them through 
Dropbox. 


Gotcha. Which of any of those tools do you feel like 
have really kind of helped you. Succeed in the work 
that you're doing. 


Yeah. I think dropbox have because it gives me the 
ability to delegate some work. So I can have four or 
five people putting in information and do a 
spreadsheet that I'm preparing for. A meeting that 
I've got, I can rely on other people that report to 
me to help me provide some of that data instead of 
me doing it all myself. 


Oh for sure. Wichiti frustrate you when you have to 
use them. 


Well, I can tell you that our tableau dashboards 
never work, right. I can tell you the tableau 
dashboard that I have with iotas right now doesn't 
work, right? So that's generally frustrating. 

Yeah. Just, you know, the fact that we sold it's 
just it's the part of the world that we live in 
right now, too. Right? Is that we solely rely on the 
Internet. And if the internet goes down, then we're 
so L and can't work. And access phones can't access 
anything. 


Yeah. How frequently do you kind of run into issues 
with technology like that? 


We haven't ran into too many issues. Lately, but 
because of our weather, we do run into some issues 
with power lines being down or lines being frozen. 
It hasn't been too bad this winter at this point in 
time. 

As we continue to push everything towards. Being 
online and making sure that we've got access. You 
know, people can work from home now they have the 
ability to do that. But nobody can work. If the 
Internet isn't working. Yes. 


Which of any of the tools kind of overlap with each 
other in terms of how they support your work. 


It seems like. You know. Google. Whether it's 
whether it's the online version of Microsoft Office 
or Smart Sheets or dropbox, you can or Google Sheet. 
I mean, you can do everything. In all of those. And 
I think right now I'm working. In every single one 
of them, I've got something different in every 
single one of them, so getting some consistency 
across the board and being able to use. Whatever. 's 
Being mandated. By our company to be able to use or 
whatever works best for us would be would be nice. 
But I'm all across the board right now. I've got a 
project that I'm working to bring a new conventional 
community into our fold. And I've got information 
via Microsoft excel. Online, and I've got three 
smart sheets that I'm tracking, so it's just be nice 
to have it all in one place when they all can 
literally do the same thing. 


Yes. Understandable. Well, on a scale of one to five 
where one is much worse and five as much improved. 
How improved is your daytoday work life based on the 
technology. You have supporting you. 


I would say a free. Talk to me more about that. Is 
that an open ended. 


Question. Yes. 


I just can't give you a number. Okay. 


Nope. 


Okay. Three. I think our technology is only so good, 
as good as the data that's being flowed into it. And 
if the data is not being able to provide me with 
what I need to get an easy answer for whomever I 
would need to be getting an answer for. Then it 
makes it a little bit frustrating. That's why I'm 
kind of in the middle. 


Yeah. 


And I know it's needed. I'm very capable of doing it 
all. And it would just be nice to have it all work 
the way that it's supposed to. 


Yeah. Well, which data is missing or which data 
isn't working the way that you need it to. 


In general, or. From. 


Specific. 


At. 


Specifics about adt that you know, I'd love to hear 
it. 


Would you? 


Yeah. That's why I'm here. 


Okay. Okay. I can tell you that I'm glad I was I was 
offered this and. Was selected to be a part of it 
because my experience with this transition from 
iotas to adt has been very frustrating. In terms of 
lack of communication and not really knowing what's 
going on and not getting answers. I think there's 
still a lot of stuff that. The ADT is missing. And 
whether they're missing it from iotas, or whether 
they're trying to take what iotis was doing and make 
it their own. I don't know, but there's a lot of. I 
myself reaching out. Often and not getting answers 
ever. Yeah. 


Well, what do you wish was different about iota ADT. 


Well, it'd be nice. One thing that has worked that 
worked really well for us over the course of us, 
integrating the iot's technology into our property 
was being able to consistently meet. I was meeting 
weekly. With. A member of staff being able to talk 
through any issues we were running into. Or just to 
make sure that we were doing okay and that we had 
what we needed. And that hasn't happened. So I think 
I don't know when the merger officially happened, 
but I think I've had two meetings during that time 
frame. So as well as a number of emails that have 
been sent out. With sometimes no response and me 
having to follow up and other times response is 
saying, okay, I'm working on this and we'll get back 
to you. And now it's three weeks later, and I still 
don't have a response and it's affecting. US on a 
daily basis in terms of the information that I need 
to have 


gotcha. Talk to me a little bit about kind of this. 
The iotas ADT products that you know you're building 
uses. 


So we so again. We're different, right? Like, I 
hate. I hate doing this, but we were a much 
different install. I think. For iotas when we came 
on board so my housing community is 780. Homes. 
Right. So I don't know. I don't remember what the 
background information was that I filled out. So 780 
homes that we had to have them go in and. Install 
the Hub and dongle and smart thermostat. This all 
happened during covet, which made the process flow. 
And not kind of happen in the time frame that we had 
hoped it to happen. You know, the biggest reason 
that we wanted to get iotus online. And have it 
functioning for us is to. Decrease the number of 
heights that we have freezing in the wintertime 
because we have some of those residents I was 
talking about before that would leave and not turn 
their eat on. So they would leave their house for 
five or six months and not turn their heat on. So 
we'd run into. We find an issue in a house and would 
go to the house next door. And that's where it 
started. And I think the year before we got iotas 
put into place, we had $250,000 and loss due to pipe 
freezes. That would not have been the case if we had 
this technology in place. So for us, it's one thing 
to have the technology in place and for the other 
part, it's for the technology to be working because 
right now we have out of 780 homes. The last report 
that I was able to run, which was back in December 
with updated information, said that we had 124 homes 
offline. So that means I've got 124 homes that 
aren't reporting data to me saying if the heat is on 
that house or not. And we've got we had three or 
four weeks this winter, and unfortunately winter's 
not over for us yet, but freezing cold temperatures 
and negative 40. Out and we've had we had some 
severe pipe freezes this winter that could have been 
avoided. Have the technology been working the way 
that it was supposed to. 


Gotcha that makes a lot of sense with those 
midwestern winters. I'm curious. You know, it makes 
sense how that technology. Was kind of knowing that 
frozen pipes definitely happen in your community. 
I'm curious about how if at all iotis ADT products 
help your resident. 


So I think. These are more. I don't know. It's 
pretty selfish, right? But I think that us putting 
this technology in place was more for us than it was 
for residents. We do know that we have a fair number 
of residents who use the app, who downloaded the app 
and who use it to adjust their thermostat in their 
house or. If they forget to turn on the heat or they 
want to bump it up when they're at work and have it 
be on and warm when they're home. They've got the 
ability to do that. I don't remember the last. Set 
of numbers that I had for how many people we have 
utilizing the app. But I know we do have some 
residents that do. But that's really the only way 
that they can use it. It's just the thermostat we 
really only have. Two houses that we have more 
technology built into that can use. It a little bit 
differently than. The majority of our residents. 


Okay. That makes sense. And then in terms of I know 
you said, you know, you got iotas during covet. So 
I'm sure things were quite different hopefully than 
they are now. Talk me, talk to me about kind of how 
you learned how to use iotas and the ADT products 
when you first got them. How did you kind of get 
trained? How did you learn about how to use them. 


So I always sent a team out here initially, to kind 
of go through. We did an initial install of like 14 
or 15 homes. Where we were able to kind of do some 
testing and kind of get a better understanding of 
how the products were gonna work and how the back of 
the end software was gonna work and how the 
dashboards work. So we did get. Good training. I 
think from that standpoint on how we could make the 
system work for us. So then it was just a matter of 
getting the entire property online. And now the 
problem is keeping the entirety property online 
because we don't have these hubs. In a tech closet 
somewhere connected to internet. There's dongle 
plugged into it. And so it just depends on what kind 
of signal. That dongle is getting as to whether that 
hub is online or whether it's it's fallen off, and 
we don't know because the residents don't use the 
app, so they don't know if they're Amazon offline or 
not. It's just there's a lot of different factors 
that go into it, but I think from iotas standpoint I 
think we did get good training. On. How the install 
worked and their tech support has remained. The 
support has remained the same in terms of when one 
of my text needs to call in and. Get some assistance 
on trying to get a hob back online or something like 
that. They're very readily available for that. 


Awesome. Well, and now kind of it sounds like, you 
know, you had this initial experience where you got 
handson learning people right there. Now when you 
have you know a new community manager, another new 
staff member joining how are they trained on iotas 
or adt if they are. 


Not really officially trained during the onboarding 
process. We certainly talk about it. And I go 
through the information. On. These homes and how 
they work and how the thermostats are connected to 
hubs and dongles. But we really don't go into. Great 
depth with new employees on it. And I certainly 
don't have. We've got seven, seven maintenance 
technicians and you know, we've got two or three 
that are we probably have one that's great with them 
that we really kind of rely on to get a hub online 
when we need to in a couple more that are the 
understanding a little bit that are not as great. At 
getting them back online. And that's what it has 
really become. It's become a secondary chore for us 
to keep homes online that aren't online. 


Gotcha being there and being 


readily available for us to use. 


And is that something that is kind of covered during 
the onboarding training that you had? Is that 
something that you're able to control or talk to me 
more about kind of resolving those. 


We get reports. Sometimes. Or get an email if 
somebody. Has clicked on their app and it's not 
working. They can submit a ticket and those get 
forwarded to me and I get our maintenance staff 
involved. And so. With us. Honestly, it's more so a 
timing thing, right? Like this is, you know, we've 
got. 14 moveouts at the end of the month and we've 
got 65 work orders in the queue. I don't have an 
extra staff member to pull offline from the normal 
work that they're doing to go try and dig into why 
this hub is not connecting right away. So a lot of 
times those things have to wait and it's a 
management. Kind of based decision on if we've got 
the time to be able to do it or not. 


Yeah, and when it comes. To kind of a new resident 
that moves in, what sort of. How are they introduced 
to the ADT IoT. 


So they get a so we have a flyer in our welcome 
packet that introduces them to the system and let 
them know that they'll and then we let them know 
that they'll be getting an email from. Adt IoT to 
set up their account so they can use the app and 
this is what it's used for. So we do go through that 
information with them. It's just a matter of whether 
residents decide to take advantage of it or not. 


Gotcha how often would you say they're using it 
today. 


You know somebody. From adt had just gotten me those 
numbers a little while ago. I don't remember what 
she had told me, but she gave me a number of how 
many people were using the app. And I think it might 
be. Maybe a third of the property, maybe a little 
bit more than that is using the app. 


Gotcha. How often would you or how many residents 
would you feel like would should be using. Kind of 
iotas ADT products to kind of get the full benefit 
of them in your opinion. 


Well, I think I think it would make more sense if 
there was more. Technology built in the house for 
them to be able to use the ad. And really feel like 
it's worth their time and effort to get to learn and 
know it if they had more that they were able to do 
with it. But right now they can control their 
thermostat. We don't have any. Ancillary. Light 
switches or outlets that they could use, that they 
can understand how. The technology could benefit 
them a little bit more. And quite frankly I don't 
even know what else is out there. In terms of AdP's 
world coming into all of this that could potentially 
benefit our residents somewhere down the road. 


I was going to ask if you had any kind of wish list 
items to be able to offer to residents. I don't know 
if you have any. I know you just said that you're 
not totally sure, 


but curious 


if you have any in mind. 


Well, I mean, I want to you know, I approve a lot 
of. What we call an exception to policy. So somebody 
would like to do something that is outside of our 
normal written policy. And a good majority of those 
are people want to add security cameras to their 
home. Or ring doorbell or something like that. And 
I'm sure adv has resolutions for all of those kinds 
of things as well, that could be built into a 
package that could be offered to analog Bridge 
residents when they move in. If that's something 
that they were interested in. But yeah. I just I 
just don't know because. It seems like we're still 
so new in this process. And communication has been 
so lackluster I really have no idea. 


Yeah. Thank you for that. I know you kind of 
mentioned that you kind of get reports. You might 
get information from. It sounds like from iota. I'm 
curious what kind of information about your 
residents are about the buildings. Do you find 
valuable that you do receive from iot's adt today. 


Well, honestly, the only report that. Concerns me or 
that I'm interested in getting right now. Is what 
homes we have offline and that's so we can try and 
fix that issue. You know, it's nice to know when we 
have. What our users are. I mean, that would be 
helpful information for me to be able to share out, 
you know, this is how many people are actually 
using. This app and the software that we spent 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to put in, you 
know, that was something that would be very 
interesting. But really knowing what homes we don't 
have online and how long they've been offline. Is 
really like my biggest priority. And you know again, 
started that priority usually starts in September. 
And it's one of those things that's been carrying on 
throughout. This entire wintertime, and I just 
haven't had that data. To really pull. There have 
been times where we get caught up and I've got two 
or three texts that I can send out if I had a list. 
And see if we could get some homes online and I 
haven't had an updated list to be able to do that. 


Gotcha 


and so 


I just want to make sure I understand right now. You 
know, if a home is offline, if you're alerted by a 
resident or a property manager, is that correct? 


I can go into the I can go into the property 
dashboard. Or I can go into. The. Tablet that's 
sitting here next to me and look at the behind this. 
I don't remember what the app is called. Right? 
It's. You'll have to forgive me. I don't remember 
what it's called. The Connect Pro app. So. You know, 
we only have two of these tablets on site because 
we're an Apple site. And the app doesn't work. With 
Apple Phones. It's not an ois right now. So you 
know, I bought two tablets so we had access to be 
able to get into the Connect Pro app. And so we 
could go in there and see. I think I can get that 
information in the Property dashboard, potentially. 
But it was nice to have this tableau report that I 
could go and download and sort. My street so I could 
give this streak to this tech and say, okay, go get 
these houses back online. Where the Connect app or 
the. Pro app or the dashboard really doesn't give me 
the ability to do that. 


Gotcha well and I'm curious kind of what level 
information is. Valuable to you so residentspecific 
how specific. Streetspecific, that type of thing. 
What level is important or valuable. 


You know. House. And streets, street and address is 
really. I mean, we don't necessarily. Would it be 
nice to have, you know, I don't know. I don't 
remember what's in the fee of what iotas adt gets 
from us from yardy, from our property management 
system, right. Like, I don't remember what all that 
data. Is but it would be nice if I had a report that 
said. What the house is, what the number is, what 
the residence name, what the residents contact 
information is. So I could give that out and say, 
okay, this is this is all the information you need 
instead of me having to pull. In data into this 
other report to say okay. Here's contact information 
for. These few people let's try and get these houses 
online. 


Gotcha is there other information about your you 
know your residents or the streets and or houses 
that you would find valuable if I ADT could find a 
way to provide it. 


No. 


Awesome. I have a couple more questions and then 
we'll get to the activity and you won't have to do 
as many openended questions. There will still be 
openended questions. Just not as many. Okay. So I'm 
curious. Kind of what we talked a little bit about, 
you know, iotas becoming ADT. Talk to me a little 
bit about the benefits that you see in iotas 
becoming ADT. 


I wish I knew. Right. I honestly wish I knew that. I 
noticed being being acquired by adt was a good 
thing. And that it was gonna provide a whole other 
level of detail to us or all other level of. 
Technology that we could potentially. You know. 

When we started this process with iotas was to have 
our community become a smart community. And really 
be able to use that as a marketing and selling point 
for us. Like, you know, these homes come with this 
and this is what you can give from them and we 
really haven't. We haven't added this into our. We 
haven't added it into our marketing because the 
technology hasn't been working the way that I think 
that it needs to in order for us to say something 
about it. I don't know. Honestly, I wish I wish I 
wish I had more information about what adt's 
bringing to the table of acquiring iotas, but I but 
I really don't know. All I know is what's not 
working right now for us and what I'm not getting 
answers on. It's really all I know since the 
transition. 


Well, I appreciate you know your candor. That's 
exactly what you know we want to hear. I'm curious 
if you have any thoughts about what risks you see 
and iotus becoming ADT. 


You know, I don't really see. I don't see the risks 
of it. You know. We we got in. We got into this like 
I said, knowing what we wanted out of it and what we 
needed out of it. And we admitted two or three other 
companies. That we were looking at at doing 
something with and felt iotas had. What we were able 
to, what we wanted and what they were able to 
provide us was more so than what we were getting 
from the other. The other demos that we did. So I 
think that that was an important. Kind of. A main 
aspect for us. And I always felt like a company. You 
know with adts. You know notoriety around the world. 
Would only bring more positive to what they're 
currently doing. I just haven't seen it yet. 


Yeah. 


And so and so I'm being very shortsighted because I 
know it's very new, but at the same time, it's 
important for you and. The observers and anybody 
who's gonna watch this to know that it's not working 
for us right now, and it's really frustrating. 


Thank you for letting us know. I'm curious you know, 
in terms of thinking about you know, adt is known as 
the security. Company, as you said, definitely known 
for that. What role do you see security playing with 
Smart technology, if any. 


Well, I think, you know, I think having the ability 
to connect. You know, if I had one app that I had 
the cameras on the outside of my house and on the 
inside of my house and had smart technology built 
into it that. Would be ideal for me, right. As a 
consumer. Because right now I've got a separate 
technology on the outside of my house for the 
different app and. I've got my ionis app in my 
house, and I got my other one for cameras inside. 
That like it'd just be nice to have it all in one 
place. And I think that and I would have thought or 
would think that iotus would have the capabilities 
to potentially do that if they're now getting into 
the smart home world if they weren't in it already. 


Yeah. What security features would you find 
beneficial to you and your properties. If any. 


Yeah, so. Exterior cameras, interior cameras. 
Thermostat locks. You know for us. I'm not sure that 
leak the textion or anything like that. Would be UN 
necessity. I know that there's. Windows and some 
different things that could potentially be done. But 
that wasn't a road that I necessarily wanted to go 
down, because as. The more technology that you 
provide in a house that people are renting, the more 
things there are for people to damage or steal or. 
You know, that's just. Kind of a part of this world. 
That I manage as well is that you just can't trust 
people. You know, we. Very purposefully. Put the 
hobs and dongle put them in a location where 
residents couldn't see them, so they didn't know 
that they were there. The system worked the way it 
was. But I think we ran into. Connectivity issues 
because of that, because of where we have them 
located. But if we put them out in public like we've 
had to do in a couple different places. People take 
off of them. And then we end up on having to charge 
for them. And. Then we and then we have to order 
more. And when we have to order more. So we have 
some on inventory. It creates a. Huge time intensive 
kind of. Budgetary suck. That. You don't generally 
always prepare for. 


Yeah. Understandable. Thank you for sharing that. We 
are going to switch gears a little bit. I'm going to 
share my screen so that we can do kind of an 
activity together. And the goal of this activity is. 
To get a better understanding of what is most 
important to you. So I'm going to share a list of 
needs that you may have in your job. And let me pull 
this up. This up that way. It makes sense as I talk 
about it. 

All right, so over here, I have a list of needs. 
That you may have in your job. I'm going to ask you 
to plot them on this pyramid at the top. You're 
going to be asked what you need them absolute most. 
So there's only one thing from that list. That's 
where it goes. There's also a couple. We have two 
blank ones. So if there's something that you need 
that we haven't. You haven't thought of will have 
you let us know and we'll kind of add that. Then the 
rest of the needs will kind of sort. In priority as 
well as most important for you to be able to have 
fulfilled and then least important will be fulfilled 
towards the bottom. So before we kind of start 
reading through these, do you have any questions. 


I don't think so. Just a little sneaky. Maslow's 
hierarchy of Needs here. 


Well, but it also Yeah. It's a little opposite, 
though, because the very important thing is that 
this. 


Is a Foundation. Yeah. So definitely not an 
architecture exercise. So. Right. 


The needs that we have for you to sort today. Are 
make the tasks I complete on a daily basis. Easier 
to do Help us attract new residents help us retain 
existing residents. Ensure myself and other property 
staff feel safe and protected. Ensure residents feel 
safe and protected. Help us identify optimizations 
to save money and increase efficiency. Help us make 
our buildings feel like a community. Make 
communicating with my team and with residents 
easier. So then we have two blank sticking notes. 
What needs do you have that are missing. 


Okay. Okay. Great. So I would think that. It's kind 
of funny, right? Because it's based on. Where we're 
at right now. But I would think what I need, what I 
would need the most. Wait. What is it? What's most 
important to me is that what the is at the top of 
the pyramid. 


Yeah. The most important for you to be able to most 
valuable. Most important for you to have. You 
particularly. 


I'm going to say. Help attract new residents. And 
then. On this next line down. Identify optimizations 
to save money. 

On a daily basis. Easier to do. 


Where do you want that one 


on that same line. And then. Let's see the next line 
down. 

Staff. And myself and other property staff feel safe 
and protected. 

And then the residence. Feels and protected. 

Help us retain existing residents. 


Here in this third line. 


Yep. And then the other four down below. 


Okay. 


That you thought of, or do you feel like this kind 
of captures? I think that captures a little bit, 
right. You know I could we could put a tab for. 
Financial. Prosperity. For my ownership group. But 
that would. Not necessary right now. So, 


yeah. So talk to me a little bit about kind of your 
process for deciding what goes where. 


So really, just like I said, this, this may be 
different. If we did this exercise six months down 
the road, it could be different. But right now. We. 
Suffered a loss in occupancy. So having other ways 
to help us. Get new residents I think. Is really 
kind of what's on my top of mind right now in terms 
of our marketing and what we're doing. So that was 
kind of why that one is my number one priority right 
now. We are always looking for different ways to. 
Save money. And increase efficiency. You know, part 
of this project for us and why we transition this 
way as well is because. You know, when we started 
this Ionis project. We were just at the beginning 
stages of replacing all of our hvac systems across 
our entire. Property. And now that we're 80% 
completed with that. Last year we started putting in 
new new windows. And patio doors to button up the 
homes and increase, you know, to make them more 
energy efficient, ideally, with the help of the 
smart thermostat that is in the house. So that's 
kind of what makes me think about that. Anything 
that can make my job easier on a daily basis is also 
very important. And then going into the residents 
and my staff and making sure that. Those people who 
live and work here feel safe and protected and. You 
know, we generally don't have as many issues. 
Retaining existing residents as we do, attracting 
new ones just in terms of where our property is 
located. So that's why that one kind of fell down a 
little bit for me. Make our buildings feel like a 
community. I mean, like I said. We're. 780 homes 
spread across 250 acre. So we're kind of a big 
property, and it's hard to really kind of Hone 
everybody in and have them feel like they're part of 
the community. A lot of people live in our property 
because they like that it's quiet and it's away from 
other things and don't want to meet neighbors and 
know people. And be a part of community gatherings 
or things like that. So I feel like that one, you 
know, is less down on our. On our pool and then make 
communication with my team. Residents ez that'd 
always be nice, right? But I feel like we've got 
some technology in place where that makes. I'm 
pretty good at that right now. So. 


That makes sense. And if iotus and adt was only able 
to meet your top three needs. Would you be happy. 


Yeah. I think it'd be okay with that. I mean, 
there's a part of. 

One of those safe and protected ones in terms of 
staff and residents that I think would be an 
important part of the deal and the package. With adt 
IoT. But yeah, the top three would be great. 


Yeah. And if you thinking about that, you know, safe 
and protected piece. Is that something where you 
would bump one of the top three out of there? Or 
would you kind of keep your top three as your top 
three. 


Could potentially. I mean, make the task that I 
complete on a daily basis easier to do. I'm not sure 
how that'd be nice, right? I'm not sure how I always 
can or at could do that for me. So I could really 
bump that one down and move. The ensuring residents 
and. Ensuring residents feel safe and protected. 


Okay. Gotcha that one's not letting me move, but I 
will remember. That you said that if push came to 
shove, those would be switched. 


We live out in a we live kind of on the outskirts 
of. The area that we live in. So I do have a third 
party security contract that comes out and drives 
the property. But. We're also private property on 
federal land. So there are certain things unless 
it's a crime, the police won't come and address any 
issues out here. So I mean, if there's things that 
iotas can do to give residents a better feeling of 
safety and security than I'm all for it. 


Yeah. And I know you mentioned that. You know. This 
year, you know, you've had more residents leave than 
usual. I'm curious kind of how or why, you know 
that's taking place, if you know. 


Yeah, it's because. It's it's. We're a product of 
our own environment, right? We transitioned into a 
revenue management system. So prior to this, I was 
managing all of our rents and generating increases 
on new leases and on renewal. And when we 
transitioned into a property management system. Our 
revenue management system. We were already at 97, 
98% occupied, so it just skyrocketed all of our 
rents. And it did that. In October and November. 
When our traffic starts dying down. And people so 
people weren't afraid to leave during that time 
frame. But people weren't interested in moving. In 
the dead of the winner so we so we saw a major 
decrease. Just because our rents increase, not 
because of anything else. 


Gotcha. All right. Thank you. Well, I have one last 
activity to do before we wrap up. And so. Let me 
scroll over. Here I have a list of. Potential 
features that iotus adt could add into their product 
experience. We'll go over them in detail. Not 
significant detail. I'll read them out loud. So if 
they're too small, I will read them. But what I want 
you to do is sort them into three different 
categories. So we have. Candy, vitamins and 
pinkillers. So candy brings temporary joy. But in 
the long run doesn't really have meaningful 
benefits. Then we have vitamins, which definitely 
will make things better, but they aren't essential. 
And then we have painkillers. So they solve for a 
painful problem. What I want you to do is to sort 
them into those categories and let me read out what 
those categories are. Residents can shop for and add 
new devices preapproved by your team. Residents have 
enhanced routine options like weather driven 
routines or ones based on who is home. Residents are 
able to monitor energy and water usage for their 
unit and receive notifications about usage. 
Residents can set up other home utilities through 
their iota Electric, Internet provider, et cetera. 
Residents receipt Proactive notifications with 
recommendations based on their behavior. So, on 
average, three lights remain on without any motion 
from 830 to four, so create an outofthe routine. 
Property staff can communicate with residents and 
other team members. Vienna. Your team can receive 
event based alerts like a water leak or a break in. 
Your team has access to. Property specific data 
insights that help determine your property health. 
Your team has access to industrywide and marketwide 
data related to multifamily homes. Residents enjoy 
using the app because the experience is easy to use 
and beautiful. And your team enjoys using the 
dashboard because the experience is easy to use and. 
Beautiful. So before we start sorting, is there 
anything missing from this list of features that you 
would hope that they might consider creating in the 
future. 


No, not really anything I can think of. 


Well with that in mind, I'm gonna have you go ahead 
and we'll sort these and I want you feel free to 
kind of talk out loud about why each one would go. 
Into each category. Just kind of your thought 
process out loud. So I don't know how you want to do 
it if you want to go note by note, or if you know 
what your pin killers are or your vitamins candy, 
that type of thing. 


Right, right. I think that the resident shopper and 
add new devices preapproved by your team. I think 
that would go into. Second category. Was that 
vitamins? 


Yeah. So. It would make things better, but aren't 
essential. 


Right. Right. And I guess I just think, you know. 
Part of me thinks that'd be great, and that's 
something that I've that I've talked about 
previously and would be interested in. But part of 
me also wonders what. The. What the costs associated 
with that type of service would be ie, for US and 
for residents and how much. 

Residents have enhanced routine options, like 
whether driven routines or ones based on who is 
home. I think that one. Is a vitamin. I think that's 
something they can kind of do with the app already, 
but I'm not sure. 

Residents are able to monitor. Energy. 

So our I mean, I think this one's probably just even 
out for us because we don't have. Our property as 
master meter. We don't have meters on all the homes 
so I don't know. How adt would pull that information 
to give them information about electrical or water 
usage when we really have we don't have any idea 
what it is, right. 


I can leave it on the outside for now. 


Yeah. I mean, if anything it would be it would be 
great. But I just don't know how it would. How would 
happen for us? Yeah. 


So if it was possible, would you put it under candy? 
Vitamin or painkiller? 


Well, I think. I mean I think if it was possible 
that it would be it would be. Very important. I 
think. 

Whichever one that what is it? Candy vitamin? And 


what candy vitamin? Pain killer is the one where it 
solves for a painful problem. 


Yeah. I mean, having residents be able to see what 
they're using, I think would justify the cost. The 
utility fees that were charging them for using 
homes. 

Again, residents can set up other home utilities, I 
guess. You know the only thing that our residents 
can really set up that isn't already provided for 
them as internet. So I think that might go into the 
vitamin area. We only have a couple minutes left, so 
I might have you do kind of a speed round for these 
remaining. Okay, stop thinking so much as much. 
Well, no, but let's focus on what you would say are 
the vibe or the pain killers. Your team can receive 
events based alerts. Yes. Painkiller. 


All right, well, actually, I'm gonna move it here. 
That way you can keep looking at I'll move them all 
at once. All right. Are there any other painkillers 


your team has access to property specific data, 
insights. I think that would be it for painkillers. 


Okay, 


since we only have two minutes left. 


No worries. I asked a lot of questions. All right. 
Are there any vitamins left so ones that aren't 
necessary, but they would be beneficial. 


I think having industrywide data would be would be a 
vitamin. 

Staff Communicating with residents. I think would be 
a vitamin Residents Proactive notifications. Yeah. I 
mean, that would. That would be candy. I think 


this one would be 


candy. Yeah. Residents enjoy using the app I think 
would be a vitamin. The dashboard, I think would be 
candy. 


Okay. 


That helps us get them sorted really quick so you 
can finish up. 


Well, I'm curious why the resident. Why the app 
experience. Experiences. Candy for staff, but 
vitamins for. Residents. 


Well, I guess I guess it depends on what the app is 
doing. You know, I guess the app for staff being 
able to provide them more access to information that 
they need would be great. You know again you know 
residents. Having I just don't I guess I don't know. 
How much interaction there is with the app. To 
really understand the Presidents would be would 
value those. Two things. 


Gotcha. So one kind of last idea. And if we're 
thinking about the sorting, if you had to put iotis 
ADT in one of those categories. So candy, vitamin or 
painkiller which would you choose. 


Well, I think that. If everything works the way that 
it's supposed to, it would be a paint killer for us. 
I think that having. A system like this in place is 
very important for us. For what. Our needs are. But 
I can get those needs from another company if I'm 
not getting what I want from iotas. So I think for 
us it's still going to be. An issue and something 
that we need to always have moving forward. It's 
just a matter of whether this transition. That we 
make in the ADT. Gets everything fixed the way that 
we need it to and we're able to move forward. In a 
positive manner. Would be whether we continue to 
stay with at IoT. 


Understandable if you could leave us one piece of 
advice as we try to improve the experience for that, 
what advice would you leave us. 


It's the same thing that everybody here is right 
communication. I would rather be over communicated 
with. And go weeks without hearing back on 14 
different questions that I asked. And that's really 
what I'm running into right now is that I've got a 
list of things that I need information about, and I 
need to know where we're at, and I haven't heard 
anything back. 


Well, thank you so much. We will let you go back to 
your day. But we appreciate you for sitting down 
with us, answering all these questions. And I will 
make sure to get your incentives sent over to you. 
Thank you. 


Okay. Sounds good, Karen. Thank you. 


Yes. Have a good rest of your day. 


All right. You too.
